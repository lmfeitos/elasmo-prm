Hexanchus griseus,"<p>The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark&#160;is infrequently reported as targeted and incidental catch from industrial and artisanal demersal trawl, longline, handline, traps, and gillnet fisheries across its range (e.g. Celona <em>et al</em>. 2005, White and Dharmadi 2010, Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013, da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The species is also targeted by recreational fishers (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012, da Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015). <br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in considerable quantities in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Post-release mortality for the species is likely to be low (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017), and the species is mostly discarded (Silva and Ellis 2019). <br/><br/>Off southeast Australia, the species has been regularly reported from demersal trawl and longline fisheries at depths of 200–600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;A semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with medium risk from current commercial&#160;fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has some refuge at depth&#160;(T. Walker unpubl. data 2019).&#160;</p><p><br/></p>",Marine,Near Threatened,Hexanchidae
Lamna nasus,"<p>The Porbeagle is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most of the catch is taken as bycatch of large-scale pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters. It may also be captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, as well as on rod on reel, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). The Northeast Atlantic stock has the longest history of commercial exploitation with the highest catches during the 1930s and 1950s (ICCAT 2010).<br/></p>  <p>Porbeagles are often retained for their meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), although fishing and/or retention is prohibited in some areas<em>. </em>Under-reporting of catches in the pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The species is highly valued by recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). The post-release mortality on commercial longlines has been reported as 10–75%&#160;(Campana <em>et al. </em>2016).&#160;</p>",Marine,Vulnerable,Lamnidae
Carcharhinus acronotus,"Blacknose Shark is captured as a retained bycatch in longlines, gillnets, trawls, and recreationally on hook and line. In the United States in 2009, estimated commercial landings were 29,230 individuals while recreational catches were 1,070 individuals (SEDAR 2011a,b). The numbers caught as bycatch in commercial shrimp trawl were estimated at 1,025 individuals. In the state of Campeche, Mexico, Blacknose Shark is targeted in gillnet and longline fisheries.&#160;<br/><br/>Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of Southwest Atlantic, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack management, and there is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery for which stocks have collapsed (P. Mejía-Falla and A. Navia pers. comm. 28/07/2018), but at the present time it is unclear how much, if any, fishing effort is still occurring in this fishery.&#160;In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015).&#160;Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth<em> et al.&#160;</em>2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) and Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>) (Lessa <em>et al. </em>2016, Reis-Filho<em> et al.</em> 2016).&#160;In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20 to 1000 m (Port <em>et al.</em> 2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those having collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011).",Marine,Endangered,Carcharhinidae
Somniosus pacificus,"The Pacific Sleeper Shark is caught as bycatch in industrial fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl and longline and is usually discarded. Post-release mortality is unknown but has been conservatively estimated as 100% (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). It is captured in recreational fisheries in the Southeast and Southcentral Alaska, however the catch is uncommon and rarely retained (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, shark fishing has a long history with sharks historically targeted by trawl and longline fisheries from the late 1920s when 6,000 t was landed annually (Chen et al. 1997). Most fisheries subsequently moved to taking shark as bycatch, except for some vessels that continued to target shark in the east and northeast of Taiwan up until at least the late 1990s; the gears included demersal longlines set at depths of 80–200 m, mid-water longline, and large-mesh drift nets (till 1992 when they were prohibited in Taiwan) (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>In Japan, prior to World War I, fisheries from the early 1800s targeted mainly Pacific Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.) and in the Bering Sea, they mainly operated in the waters above the continental shelf and slope of the Bering Sea (Hayashi 1991). Fisheries developed rapidly in Japan during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). Deep-water trawl fisheries across Japan mostly operate at 200–800 m but in some parts of northern Japan, they operate to 1,500 m. Deep-water longline fisheries mostly operate at depths of 400–800 m (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/>Russian survey catch data from 1980 to 2014 indicated this species was caught in the Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, and in the Pacific Ocean with demersal and mid-water trawls with catches ranging from 1 to 67 individuals per trawl and a total of 798 individuals captured over the 35 years (I. Volvenko unpubl data 2019). In Russia, prior to World War I, fisheries mostly operated in inland waters. During the 1930s, fisheries gradually shifted to coastal waters and expanded to marine waters and foreign fleets during the late 1940s to early 1950s with fishing in the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, and western Bering Sea and further in the 1960s to the eastern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska targeting herring and bottom fish with large, factory stern trawlers (Pruter 1976).<br/><br/>In the Northeast Pacific, from 1860 to 1920, fisheries mostly targeted Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.) with pelagic fisheries increasing in effort between World War I and II and sharks (Squaliformes) a minor component of the catch (Diemling <em>et al</em>. 1994). In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI), Pacific Sleeper Shark are now captured mainly in the Pacific Cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>) longline and the Walleye Pollock (<em>Gadus chalcogrammus</em>) trawl fisheries (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020b). In the Gulf of Alaska, the species is mainly captured in the flatfish fisheries and Pacific Halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) longline fisheries (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>The species may be caught as bycatch on the Emperor Seamounts. The fisheries have operated since 1967 and fished heavily during the 1960s to 1980s mostly at depths of 300–600 m (Baco <em>et al</em>. 2019). The fisheries currently operate mostly in the Southern Emperor seamounts at depths of 300–500 m. However, some Japanese gillnets may operate at 300–1,300 m and an exploratory South Korea longliner operated at depths of 250–1,050 m in the mid-2000s (CHM 2016, Shotton 2016, NPFC 2020). The demersal trawl fisheries mainly target North Pacific Armourhead (<em>Pentaceros wheeleri</em>) that do not occur below depths of 800 m and Splendid Alfosino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) that occurs at depths of 25–1,300 m (Froese and Pauly 2019, NPFC 2020).<span><span

Etmopterus pusillus,"The Smooth Lanternshark is occasionally taken as bycatch in demersal and midwater trawl, demersal longline, and trammel net fisheries across much of its range. Its peak abundance occurs ~400 m depth (Moura <em>et al.</em> 2018), well within the depth range of deep-water fishing activities (Victorero <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;When reported, the Smooth Lanternshark is generally reported in small quantities (e.g. Akhilesh <em>et al.</em> 2011, Francis 2015, da Silva <em>et al. </em>2015, Pajuelo <em>et al.</em> 2016, Frietas <em>et al. </em>2018, Facounnet <em>et al</em>. 2019). In the Northeast Atlantic, Norway reported the largest catches of lanternsharks (<em>Etmopterus&#160;</em>spp.), reaching 129 t in 2017; most of the catch is discarded (ICES-WGEF&#160;2018).

Etmopterus lucifer,"<p>The Blackbelly Lanternshark is taken incidentally in midwater and benthic trawl and longline (Oh <em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Francis 2015). It is considered to have low catchability due to its small size and may be able to escape trawl nets, thus suffering relatively low fishing mortality (Dunn <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the Northwest Pacific, the Blackbelly Lanternshark was the most frequently recorded species on benthic longline at depths between 300-550 m (Oh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). In a qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans, this species was categorised at low-moderate risk from commercial fishing (Ford<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;</p>",Marine,Least Concern,Etmopteridae
Mustelus norrisi,"<p>The Narrowfin Smoothhound is captured in recreational fisheries, commercial trawl fisheries and in commercial and artisanal driftnets, gillnets, and longlines. In the United States (US), combined <em>Mustelus</em> spp. landings averaged ~33,000 individuals in recreational fisheries from 2012–2016. Commercial landings were 318 metric t dressed weight in 2016. However, total landings for this species are likely much lower as these are summarized for combined <em>Mustelus</em> spp. from both the US Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries in many areas. In the Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack management, and there is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery for which stocks have collapsed (P. Mejía-Falla and A. Navia pers. comm. 14 July 2018) but at the present time it is unclear how much, if any, fishing effort is still occurring in this fishery. In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). The Narrowfin Smoothhound is caught on longlines and in gillnets there in lower numbers now than in the past (Tavares 2005). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1000 m (Port <em>et al.</em> 2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense and unmanaged, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those having collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). Overall, this shark is captured in managed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico, but elsewhere is subjected to unmanaged commercial and artisanal fishing pressure, and the population is not monitored.</p>

Carcharhinus isodon,"In the United States (US), Finetooth Shark is captured in coastal gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries. It is targeted in recreational fisheries particularly in the southeast United States. In 2000, estimated commercial landings were 69,258 lbs dressed weight while recreational catches of small coastal sharks were 86,167 lbs (Cortés 2002). In 2015, US commercial landings were&#160;8,712 lbs (dressed weight) with 326 individuals landed recreationally (NMFS 2017).<br/><br/>Fisheries in Brazil include extensive subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries that are economically important for the country’s large population. Industrial gears include trawls, seines, gillnets, longlines, and handlines (Freire <em>et al. </em>2015). Artisanal fisheries are dominated by driftnetting and to a lesser extent shrimp fishing (Freire <em>et al.</em> 2015). Many artisanal fishers use both gillnets and longlines. Elasmobranchs are a bycatch in much of Brazil, and in some places, they are targeted. Brazil is one of the major shark meat consuming nations in the world (R. Barretto pers. comm. 30/06/2018). In Maranhão State, elasmobranchs made up 60% of the total catch between 1970 and 1980. In the past (from 1990–2010) the market for shark products has been largely for the fin trade and fins have been exported to Hong Kong for a high price (Cardeñosa <em>et al. </em>2020). Recently this trade has shifted, and the demand and price of shark meat locally have increased substantially to surpass that of fins (Martins<em> et al.</em> 2018). According to fisher interviews, the value of shark fins in the state of Maranhão has declined by 85% since 2005 (Martins <em>et al.</em> 2018). Shark meat is consumed locally fresh or dried and salted. Species commonly caught in artisanal fisheries include Blacknose Shark (<em>Carcharhinus acronotus</em>), Bull Shark (<em>C. leucas</em>), Blacktip Shark (<em>C. limbatus</em>), Smalltail Shark (<em>C. porosus</em>), Tiger Shark (<em>Galeocerdo cuvier)</em>, Atlantic Nurse Shark (<em>Ginglymostoma cirratum</em>), Caribbean Sharpnose Shark (<em>Rhizoprionodon porosus</em>), and hammerheads (<em>Sphyrna </em>spp.), many of which are threatened (Martins <em>et al.</em> 2018). Fishers in Maranhão state have consistently reported declines in shark populations despite increased effort. These fishers also indicated that some species (Smalltail Shark, and Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>)) were previously abundant and are now very rare, and are likely at a high risk of local extinction (Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2016, Martins <em>et al. </em>2018, Santana <em>et al.</em> 2020). Species such as angel sharks (<em>Squatina</em> spp.) and guitarfishes (Rhinobatidae) have also declined substantially (R. Barretto pers. comm. 30 May 2018). Brazil is one of the world’s top importers of shark meat. Imports have increased more than eight-fold since 2000 (Dent and Clarke 2015). This increase in imports indicates a growing market in Brazil and could potentially be indicative of depleted domestic stocks. Overall the fisheries catch in Brazil is increasingly coming from overexploited stocks, and the number of overexploited and collapsed stocks has increased, especially since the 1980s (Pauly and Zeller 2015).&#160;<br/><strong></strong>",Marine,Near Threatened,Carcharhinidae
Carcharhinus altimus,"The Bignose Shark is caught globally as mostly bycatch in pelagic longline and purse seine, gillnet, and bottom trawl fisheries and generally retained for the meat and fins (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018). Its migratory behaviour from the seafloor to shallow waters at night increases its susceptibility to capture in the widespread pelagic tuna fisheries. Commercial at-vessel-mortality in pelagic longline fisheries is highly variable ranging from 0–60% (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2012, Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017). Under-reporting of this species is also likely due to misidentification as the Sandbar Shark (<em>C. plumbeus</em>).<br/><br/> In the United States (US) pelagic longline fishery (east coast of the US, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean), this species represented 5.3% of the catch from 1987–2010 based on fisher logbook data (Lynch <em>et al.</em> 2018).  It was ranked among the top seven coastal sharks at risk from the ICCAT  longline fisheries based on productivity and susceptibility  (Arrizabalaga <em>et al. </em>2011), However, the species was only infrequently captured prior to 2010 with no reported captures from 2010–2017 (ICCAT 2018). It was taken in directed artisanal fisheries in the Central Mexican Pacific during the mid-1990s (Pérez-Jiménez e<em>t al. </em>2005), although there is no data since on catches in that fishery.<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, off Brazil, the Bignose Shark&#160;is taken  incidentally by commercial fisheries on the outer continental shelf and  continental slope. The species was first identified and recorded from  the catches of tuna longliners operating out of Santos (São Paulo State,  southern Brazil) by Sadowsky and Amorim (1977). It is seldom caught by  this fleet but retained when caught and sold as ""other sharks"" (Arfelli  and Amorim 1994). This species was also taken in directed artisanal shark  longline fisheries around the Venezuelan oceanic islands in 1997–1998 (Tavares 2005), although there is no data since on catches in that fishery.<br/><br/> In the Mediterranean Sea, this shark was a significant bycatch of the  pelagic longline fishery operating from eastern Algerian ports (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2005). In West African waters, the Bignose Shark is infrequently caught (Diop  and Dossa 2011). In South Africa, it has been only reported as captured  in the bather protection programme (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015).<strong><br/></strong><br/><strong></strong><strong></strong>The Bignose Shark&#160;is taken in tuna fisheries and bottom trawls in the  Western Indian Ocean and probably by line or gillnet off India; there  are only isolated reports of its occurrence in Indian waters and in the  Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) longline fisheries where it is rarely reported (Kizhakudan <em>et al. </em>2015, IOTC 2018, E. Romanov pers. comm.&#160;09/02/2017). It was taken by nearshore pelagic longline around the Maldives where catch rates were reported by fishermen to have declined significantly (C.  Anderson pers. comm. 25/05/2007);<strong> </strong>however, shark fishing in the Maldives has been banned since 2010. Whole  individuals are consumed and traded at local markets in the Philippines  (SEAFDEC 2006). In  Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, this species is caught occasionally by shark longline, gillnet, and coastal fishers (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, White <em>et al.</em> 2017).<strong><br/></strong><br/><strong></strong><strong></strong>It is taken in the Western Central Pacific Ocean in  longline and purse seine gears but only in low numbers of &lt; 5  individuals per purse seine set and mostly &lt;5 individuals per 1,000  longline hooks (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016). It is infrequently  captured in beach meshing programs in Australia, accounting for &lt;0.1%  of the total shark catch from 1962–2017 (Roff<em> et al. </em>2018). It has also been reported in low numbers from the West Australian Pilbara Fish Trawl Fishery (McAuley <em>et al. </em>2005).",Marine,Near Threatened,Carcharhinidae
Alopias superciliosus,"<p>  </p><p>The Bigeye Thresher is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most catch is taken as bycatch of commercial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martinez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015, Temple <em>et al. </em>2019, Fauconnet <em>et al. </em>2019). The Bigeye Thresher generally spends time near the surface at night where it is exposed to fisheries capture but it likely has some refuge during the day, when it generally dives to greater depths than those at which most commercial tuna fleets operate.<br/></p>  <p>The species is often retained for the quality meat and the fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention. Under-reporting of catches is likely in pelagic and domestic fisheries (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The species is highly valued by big-game recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due the likelihood of post-release mortality that has been estimated for the congener Common Thresher&#160;as 78% for tail-hooked and 0% for mouth-hooked animals (i.e. all mouth-hooked animals survived) (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Sepulveda <em>et al. </em>2015). For commercial fisheries, at-vessel hooking mortality for the Bigeye Thresher is high with between 49 and 68% of individuals caught found to be dead on haulback (Coelho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, IOTC 2016).</p>",Marine,Vulnerable,Alopiidae
Squalus suckleyi,"The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, despite being naturally abundant, are susceptible to overfishing due to its life history characters (see <em>Habitat and Ecology</em> section). The life history parameters of this species lend itself to be more sensitive to fishing mortality than the closely-related species, Spiny Dogfish (S. acanthias), which is assessed to be globally Vulnerable. The market for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish is expected to increase due to the decline of more traditional groundfish stocks (Fordham 2009), closure of European Union Spiny Dogfish fisheries, and the continuing international demand for shark fins, especially from certified fisheries. The discards and non-target catch data are likely severely underestimated as well (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). Despite all of these pressures, the trend data and stock statuses indicate that this species is not currently under any major threat and none are expected in the near future.<br/><br/>The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish has historically been landed both commercially and recreationally in most parts of its range. Catches and landings for each stock are listed separately below. For the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian and U.S. waters, many landings and fishery information are lumped together in most of the literature. The following paragraph is for all North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian and U.S. waters, and then below, if there is known information for a specific stock, it is described.<br/><br/>There are four major eras of the commercial fishery for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish off the west coast of North America, starting with the 1870–1916 time period (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). During this fishery, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were primarily exploited for reduction into oil for lubrication, lighting, and fertilizer (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The highest volume of oil produced at this time was 1.2 million liters in 1883 (Ketchen 1986). The maximum average weight annually was almost 4,700 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The average annual catch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish from this time period was 4,690 mt (Argue and Shepard 2005 in Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The second era was from 1917–1939, and during this time North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were exploited for reduction into industrial oil and fish meal (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The average annual catch during this time was 4,486 mt (Argue and Shepard 2005 in Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The third era from 1937–1950 was known as the ‘Great Vitamin Liver fishery’ where North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were exploited for their livers as a source of vitamin A (Ketchen 1986, Beamish et al. 2009). The landings during this time peaked at 31,000 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). After the discovery of synthetic vitamin A, the fishery collapsed (Ketchen 1986). During 1951–1974, the Canadian government subsidized the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish fishery. It is estimated that 6.7 million fish were taken during this time, all from the Strait of Georgia (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). From 1980–2001, catches in the Strait of Georgia comprised 30% of the total catch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in British Columbia (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). A fishery developed in Washington State in 1975 for human consumption, but the numbers fell through 1981 due to the decline of larger females (Ketchen 1986). In British Columbia, a fishery developed in 1977 for human consumption, with a peak in production in 1979 followed by sharp declines in the 1980s (Ketchen 1986).<br/><br/><em><strong>Northeast Pacific offshore stock</strong></em>:<br/>In the U.S., the offshore stock has been commercially fished since 1916 if not before, with two peaks: one in the 1940s (vitamin A liver fishery) and the other in the 1970s (food fishery) (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). During the vitamin A liver fishery, the landings peaked at 16,876 mt, with an average of 6,821 mt per year (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). In the past decade, the landings have remained lower, ranging from 164 to 876 mt (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). As of September 2011, the MSC certified the ‘British Columbia North Pacific Spiny Dogfish’ fishery as sustainable (MSC 2011). The MSC is an international non-profit organization that oversees third party objective fishery assessments (MSC 2016a). If the assessment finds that a specific fishery has healthy stocks, minimal ecosystem impacts, and an effective fisheries management system, they certify the fishery as sustainable and label the seafood as such (MSC 2016a). The MSC fishery for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish uses bottom longlines and trawl gear for both the offshore stock and the stock in the Strait of Georgia (MSC 2016b). Around 3,000 mt of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are taken annually and this catch is lower than the current ‘Total Allowable Catch’ (TAC) for British Columbia (9,250 mt; MSC 2011). In the U.S. today, most of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish commercially landed are from Washington State (accounts for 90% of landings in U.S.) and for the last 10 years, landings have ranged between 164 and 876 mt (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). This species is commonly caught as bycatch today, with the majority discarded at sea (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). There are three fishing techniques that currently catch dogfish: trawl, hook and line, and a variety of nets (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). The recreational catch of this species does not account for a large proportion (1% verses 99% commercial) of total landings, but this statistic does not include any discards, which are believed to be considerable since the general statistic for discards is that 91% of encountered North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are discarded at sea (Bargmann and Zielinski 2009).<br/><br/><strong><em>The Puget Sound inshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>This stock has experienced two catch peaks in the past 80 years in terms of commercial fishing, and is currently at low levels (Palsson 2009). Before World War II, the catches were below 1,000 mt per year, and beginning in the 1940s, landings increased from less than a few hundred mt per year to over 4,000 mt per year (Palsson 2009). Following that peak, catches declined in the 1950s and 1960s to less than 1,000 mt per year, and almost to zero in the early 1970s (Palsson 2009). The mid-1970s marked the beginning of the second peak, with catches increasing to over 1,500 mt per year in the late 1970s through early 1980s, peaking at 4,000 mt per year in 1979 (Palsson 2009). In the following years (mid-1980s through mid-1990s), the harvest further declined to less than 1,000 mt per year and then to 300 mt per year starting in 1997 (Palsson 2009). These catch data do not include discards (Palsson 2009). Between 1982 and 2000, &gt;70% of the harvest was from the northern part of the Sound, although during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the harvest was more equal between the northern and southern Sound (Palsson 2009). The Washington [State] Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) Puget Sound Survey indicated that North Pacific Spiny Dogfish abundance was at a low level, but the estimates from 2001 were higher than 1997 (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><strong><em>Strait of Georgia inshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>The commercial fishery for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the Strait of Georgia dates back to the 1800s, with several peaks and troughs throughout its history. In the first era during 1870–1916, 65% of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish exploited were from the Strait of Georgia (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). During the second era from 1917–1939, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were almost exclusively taken from the Strait of Georgia, with an estimation of 143,038 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The annual average catch was 4,486 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). During the government subsidized fishing era (1951–1974), 6.7 million fish, or 22,872 mt of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were taken from the Strait of Georgia (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). Again, from 1980–2001, catches in the Strait of Georgia comprised 30% of the total catch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in British Columbia (Beamish et al. 2009). Since 2006, commercial fisheries for groundfish have 100% observer at-sea monitoring to account for bycatch (Mawani 2009). North Pacific Spiny Dogfish from this stock are also caught in the certified MSC fishery (see above).<br/><br/><strong><em>Alaskan stock</em></strong>: <br/>There is no directed fishery in Alaska (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011), although this species makes up a large proportion of bycatch in many economically valuable fisheries, namely longline fisheries for sablefish (<em>Anoplopoma fimbria</em>), Pacific Cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>), and Pacific Halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) (Conrath and Foy 2009, Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2010, Gasper and Kruse 2013). Information on the bycatch in Alaska is as follows, and is taken from the pre-STAR report for the Pacific Management Fishery Council meeting 11–15 July 2011 to asses the status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, and is from various sources. North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are taken from the Gulf of Alaska in the Pacific Salmon gillnet fisheries, sablefish fisheries, Pacific Halibut longline fisheries, and groundfish trawl fisheries (Boldt 2003 in Gertseva and Taylor 2011). Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated that an average of 530 tons per year of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were taken from 1997–2007. Furthermore, the bycatch from State waters is not completely known (but estimates are documented in various reports, e.g. <a href=""https://pices.int/publications/pices_press/volume8_issue2/May00/Shark.pdf"">https://pices.int/publications/pices_press/volume8_issue2/May00/Shark.pdf</a>) and the bycatch from Federal waters are considered to be a conservative estimate due to the incomplete observing of fisheries (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). The NMFS and International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) Gulf of Alaska surveys that collectively cover 1984–2003 indicate that there is a stable trend with increasing catch rates in 2003, and overall both indicate that North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Gulf of Alaska are stable or even increasing (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009, Conrath and Foy 2009, Andrews and Foy 2009).<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Japanese waters</strong></em>:<br/>In Japan, this species has historically been landed and used. Beginning in 1990, a fishery developed for the bycatch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish from bottom longline fishing vessels targeting Pacific cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>) or Pacific halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) in Hokkaido, and Aomori, Akita, and Ishikawa prefectures (northern part of Honshu, and central area of the Japan Sea coast, respectively). The fishery intensity reflected the oscillating price of fishmeal fertilizer (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Hokkaido, a bottom gillnet fishery (with the exception of one prefecture using longline) developed during the same time (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). During WWII, the bottom longline fishery expanded off Hokkaido and then into the sea of Okhotsk after WWII resulting from the increased demand from increased numbers of fish meal and liver oil factories (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Industrial bottom trawling for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish began, but soon shifted to bottom longlining (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). The ‘total shark landing of Japan' was 50,000 mt in 1947 but it soon increased to 120,000 mt in 1950 (Taniuchi 1990 in Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). From 1951–1955, the average North Pacific Spiny Dogfish catch was over 44,000 mt (Nakano et al. 2009). From 1956–1959 the catch was about 30,000 mt per year, and from 1959–1967, the catch decreased steadily to less than 10,000 mt per year (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Unfortunately, in 1968, landing statistics for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, Salmon Shark (<em>Lamna ditropis</em>), Blue Shark (<em>Prionace glauca</em>), and ‘other’ shark were combined into one category (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Since the 1950s, catches have greatly declined, and Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009) stated that it was probably due to a reduction in stocks, decreased demand, and low prices (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Most recently, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are caught in the offshore bottom trawl fishery, with catches ranging from 1,000 mt (1970s) to less than 500 mt in recent years (Nakano et al. 2009). North Pacific Spiny Dogfish continues to be caught incidentally in local and offshore industrial fisheries (Nakano et al. 2009). Since North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are currently caught in the Aomori prefecture with bottom longlines, the larger females are more vulnerable due to their schooling and demersal nature (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Currently, the majority of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish is caught by the offshore bottom trawl fishery (Kitagawa 2005 in Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009) and bottom longline fishery (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009), which selectively fishes for the mature members of the population, frequently mature pregnant females. Catch rates in Danish seines and bull trawls fell 90% from 100–200 kg per haul in the mid 1970s to 10–20 kg per haul in the late 1990s (Fisheries Agency of Japan 2003 in Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Despite the decline in fishing effort in the inshore waters, (specifically the number of tows by the Japanese Danish seine fishery) since 2003, the CPUE (kg/tow) has increased in the same time period (Nakano et al. 2009). In addition, the fishery effort had increased from the early 1970s through 1990, and decreased since (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009) concluded that the Japanese population of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish decreased historically and stayed low. In addition, Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009) reported that an assessment report by Kitagawa (2005), that stated that the life history parameters of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish prevented it from restoring to pre-fished levels, and that fishing effort should not be increased.<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Russian waters</strong></em>: <br/>In Russian waters, a directed fishery for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish occurred pre-WWII, in which several mt were exploited annually (multiple authors in Orlov and Tokranov 2009). Currently, there is no directed fishery for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, but they are incidentally caught in the Pacific salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus</em> spp.) fisheries (Grigorov and Orlov 2013). North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are commonly caught near the bottom off the coast of Eastern Russia (around the Sea of Okhotsk), Kuril Islands, Aleutian Islands, and eastern Bering Sea (Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2011).",Marine,Least Concern,Squalidae
Carcharhinus limbatus,"The Blacktip Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal and industrial fisheries with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is retained for its valuable meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The species is caught in recreational fishing and mostly released and is also caught in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010, Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011, SEDAR 2020). Post-release mortality of sharks released alive was estimated at 44% and 31% for the United States commercial demersal longlines and gillnets respectively, and 19–23% for recreational line fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico (Mohan <em>et al</em>. 2020, SEDAR 2020).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense and there are largely unmanaged commercial fisheries in many areas. For e.g., in Venezuela, industrial and artisanal fisheries have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Off western Africa, fishing effort has increased in both efficiency and intensity during the past 50 years. For e.g, effective fishing effort of the small-scale fleet operating off Mauritania is estimated to have increased by a factor of 10 during the past 25 years (Gascuel 2007). The Blacktip Shark is occasionally caught in the Mediterranean Sea driftnet fishery (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). Across Southeast Asia, historic and current fishing pressure is high and intensive. For e.g., the South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008).<br/><br/>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC 2019).",Marine,Vulnerable,Carcharhinidae
Carcharhinus obscurus,"<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>The Dusky Shark is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most of the catch is taken as bycatch of commercial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (McCandless <em>et al.</em> 2014). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Martínez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species is often retained for the meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, <em></em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention<em>.</em> Under-reporting of catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The  species is taken in recreational fishing and beach protection programs  that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011, McCandless<em> et al. </em>2014).  At-vessel mortality was estimated at 34% in the US pelagic  longline fishery, 81% in the Northwest Atlantic bottom longline fishery,  and 1.3% on Western Australia demersal longlines (McCandless <em>et al.</em>  2014, Braccini and Waltrick 2019). Post-release mortality was estimated  as up to 67% in the Northwest Atlantic bottom longline fishery, though  markedly reduced when individuals were retained for less than 3 hours on the line  (McCandless <em>et al.</em> 2014).",Marine,Endangered,Carcharhinidae
Carcharhinus plumbeus,"<em></em>The Sandbar Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. The species is an important component of target industrial shark fisheries, and is also captured as bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries. It is captured with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl and retained for its meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The species is also captured in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, SEDAR 2017, Roff <em>et al</em>. 2018). At-vessel mortality of Sandbar Sharks varies from 3–63% for trawl, and demersal and pelagic longline, with research indicating that on longlines, larger individuals have higher mortality (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017). Short term post-release mortality of 25% was found for Sandbar Sharks caught on research longlines and released alive and in good condition (Barnes <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense and there are largely unmanaged industrial fisheries in many areas. For e.g., in Venezuela, industrial and artisanal fisheries have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Off southern Brazil, intensive fishing on pupping and nursery grounds is thought to have caused excessively high juvenile mortality (Musick <em>et al</em>. 2009). Off western Africa, fishing effort has increased in both efficiency and intensity during the past 50 years and has been linked with declines in demersal fish stocks in several areas of the region, including Senegal and Guinea, and most notably, in higher-trophic level predators, such as sharks (Gascuel 2007). The Sandbar Shark has been intensively exploited and overfished in both coastal and pelagic waters of the Mediterranean Sea (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Mozambique and Tanzania, artisanal fishing pressure has increased dramatically over the past 50 years and is intense with reported declines in sharks due to this increased pressure (Jacquet <em>et al</em>. 2010, Benkenstein 2013, Katikiro <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Across Southeast Asia, historic and current fishing pressure is high and intensive. For e.g., the South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). In Hawaii, the Sandbar Shark is incidentally captured as a minor component (~0.1% of observed catches) of the shark bycatch in the pelagic tuna longline fishery (Walsh <em>et al</em>. 2009). The species’ presence in inshore and estuarine waters and its use of coastal nursery areas means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing.",Marine,Endangered,Carcharhinidae
Carcharias taurus,"The Sand Tiger Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal, recreational, and industrial fisheries with multiple fishing gears including longline, line, gillnet, and trawl. It is mostly retained for its meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The species is also a bycatch of beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Australia, during the 1960s and 1970s this species was actively persecuted and killed off New South Wales by spear fishers (Reid and Krogh 1992). At-vessel mortality has been reported as zero for demersal longlines and when released from both longlines and rod-and-reel, the species has high survival rates (Carslon <em>et al</em>. 2009, Kneebone <em>et al</em>. 2013, Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017, Kilfoil <em>et al</em>. 2017). In South Africa, this species is captured in the recreational shore angling fishery (Smale 2002, Dicken <em>et al</em>. 2006). Tag recapture data has shown that pregnant sharks are philopatric to their gestation areas in northern KwaZulu-Natal, within the iSimangaliso Marine Protected Area (Dicken <em>et al</em>. 2007). Concern had been expressed that the increase in tourist SCUBA divers over the past 10 years may be impacting the number of Sand Tiger Sharks seen in the iSimangaliso MPA. However, a recent study from 2019 to 2020 suggests that this may not be the case (Staiger 2020).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, artisanal fisheries are intense and there are largely unmanaged industrial fisheries in many areas. In Brazil, large aggregations of the Sand Tiger Shark were targeted and eradicated in Santa Catarina state by spear fishermen in the 1970s and 1980s (Chiaramonte <em>et al</em>. 2007). In the Mediterranean, unmanaged spear fishing and unregulated coastal fisheries may have caused the acute decline of the Sand Tiger Shark (Fergusson <em>et al</em>. 2000). Off western Africa, fishing effort has increased in both efficiency and intensity during the past 50 years. For e.g, effective fishing effort of the small-scale fleet operating off Mauritania is estimated to have increased by a factor of 10 during the past 25 years (Gascuel 2007). In the Arabian Seas region, there is high and increasing fishing pressure on the species' inshore habitats. For e.g., In Iran, the number of fishers increased from 70,729–109,601 from 1993 to 2002 (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006), and in Gujarat state, India, the number of trawlers increased from 6,600–11,582 from the early 2000s to 2010 (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004, CMFRI 2010). Across Southeast Asia, historic and current fishing pressure is high and intensive. For e.g., the South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008).<br/><br/>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing for aquaculture and development, and climate change. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC 2019). Conversely, climate change is predicted to create additional available habitat for the species in some areas, which may contribute to recovery and resilience of the species (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><p></p>  <p></p>",Marine,Critically Endangered,Odontaspididae
Notorynchus cepedianus,"<p>The&#160;Broadnose Sevengill Shark&#160;is infrequently reported as target and incidental catch from industrial and artisanal demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries across its range (Walker and Gason 2007,&#160;da Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015,&#160;Gonzalez-Pestana<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2016). It is also captured by recreational fishers (Walker and Gason 2007, Barbini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Discard rates are unknown, but fishing mortality is high; at-vessel-mortality estimates from gillnet fisheries range from 33<a name=""_Hlk25584564"">–</a>85% (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;</p><p>Off southeast Australia, the species has been regularly reported from demersal trawl, longline, gillnet and dropline fisheries at depths of 200–600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;A semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current commercial&#160;fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has some refuge at depth&#160;(T.

For example, 97 individuals were reported from a single overnight gillnet fishing operation in Samborombón Bay, Argentina (De Wysiecki <em>et al</em>. 2018). Discrete populations with little evidence of migration increases the risk of localized population reduction. The Broadnose Sevengill Shark may also be susceptible to coastal development and environmental changes given its reliance on inshore habitat (Milessi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).</p>",Marine,Vulnerable,Hexanchidae
Centrophorus granulosus,"<p>The Gulper Shark is taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and demersal trawl, surface and demersal longline, and setnet fisheries.<br/><br/>Where targeted fishing occurs, fishing activity is intensive. Deep-water dogfishes, including a number of&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp, are targeted and/or retained as bycatch throughout Indonesia for their high value liver oil (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009, Gunawan 2013, Samusamu and Dharmadi 2017). Fisheries occur at depths of 200–800 m (Samusamu and Dharmadi, 2017), but have also been reported near shore at depths &lt;100 m (Gunawan 2013). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across Indonesia, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in many areas across the Indo-West Pacific (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2006).&#160;Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high, but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). <br/><br/>Gulper sharks&#160;have been historically exploited commercially in the Northeast Atlantic. Most catch is thought to comprise Leafscale Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>), however, catches of Gulper Shark are thought to have been misidentified with this species. Landings of the Leafscale Gulper Shark were historically aggregated with other deep-water dogfish (primarily the Portuguese Dogfish,&#160;<em>Centroscymnus coelolepis</em>)&#160;in a mixed landing category, referred to as “siki” shark (ICES-WGEF 2018). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, deep-water sharks are still captured in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;Discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sánchez 2017) and the extent of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is unknown (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, <a style="""">there was an apparent increase in reported landings</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Kainge<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches of deep-water sharks <a>are difficult to </a>determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Gulper Sharks are occasionally reported (&lt;1 t annually between 2010–12) in demersal trawl and hake longline fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>In India, fisheries employing a number of gear types (trawl, longline, gill net, hook and line) have expanded further offshore into deeper waters as inshore stocks become heavily exploited. A targeted gulper shark (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp) liver oil fishery (operating at depths of &gt;300–1,000 m) commenced in 2002, and during the period 2002–2008, there was a major increase in landings of deep-water sharks (see Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, 2013, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013). Targeting fishing has occurred off the Andaman Islands&#160;since the 1980s (Soundararajan and Roy 2004). Reports of large quantities of shark liver oil recently transported out of Somalia may be indicative of developing fisheries in this region (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2019). Gillnet catches of the Gulper Shark peaked at 128 t in 2013 and declined to 30 t in 2015; an additional 102 t of the species was taken in the same year using longline gear (Georgeson<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Gulper Shark to have high to extreme vulnerability across all fisheries in Southern Indian Ocean (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;</p>",Marine,Endangered,Centrophoridae
Squatina occulta,"The major threats to populations of Hidden Angelshark are bottom trawls and bottom-set gillnets. <br/><br/>Until 1989, bottom trawl gears targeting demersal fish mainly caught <em>Squatina</em> species in Brazil. Although this type of fishing gear continues to operate, from 1990 the introduction of bottom gillnets increased on the shelf and slope off southern Brazil, leading to an increase in the capture of angel shark species. Gillnets were reported as six times more effective at catching angel sharks than trawling alone (Vooren and Klippel 2005). This efficiency is due to two factors: first, the nocturnal behavior of the species determines the high vulnerability to night fishing with bottom gillnets; secondly, this fleet practices directed fishing of angel sharks with stretched mesh of 35 to 40 cm between opposing nodes. For these reasons, fishing with gillnets is the main threat to the remaining populations of <em>Squatina</em> species (Vooren and Klippel 2005). Although angel sharks were heavily targeted by these nets in the early 2000s, depletion has led them to be caught more infrequently and the targeted fishery is no longer profitable (Mafra Pio <em>et al.</em> 2016). Currently, the Itajaí fleet (Santa Catarina, Brazil) is responsible for most of the fishing effort on the South Platform. In 2007, in the port of Itajaí, 61% of the <em>Squatina</em> catches came from the bottom gillnet fleet, and 39% from bottom trawling. These two fishing modalities are the main extrinsic factors that affect the population of this species in Brazil (Miranda and Vooren 2003, Vooren and Klippel 2005).<br/><br/>Gravid females have been observed to abort embryos easily upon capture, further reducing the reproductive capacity (Vooren and Klippel 2005). A low rate of dispersal between populations also makes them especially prone to local depletion and means that recolonization will be extremely low. <br/><br/>In Uruguay, there is little direct fishing for  angel sharks, but they are taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal  fisheries (Paesch and Domingo 2003).<br/>In Argentina, Chiaramonte (1998) stated that <em>Squatina</em> species were the second most important fish landed by the gillnet fleet of Puerto Quequen (Buenos Aires Province), however this was mostly the Angular Angelshark.",Marine,Critically Endangered,Squatinidae

Tope is generally retained for the meat, fins, and liver oil (Dent and Clarke 2015). Where it is taken as bycatch, it is mainly retained (as byproduct) but when released, at-vessel-mortality varies by gear: in gillnets, it ranges from 2–73% and on longlines it is reported as 0% (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, Tope is a bycatch that is discarded in some fisheries but retained in others and is an important target species for recreational fisheries in some areas (ICES 2019). The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) recommended landings be limited to 376 t annually in 2018 and 2019 (ICES 2019). Landings data are incomplete, as some landings are reported in aggregated landings categories, for example, 'Dogfish and Hounds', and not all range states report species-specific data. The annual reported species-specific Tope landings of the Northeast Atlantic subpopulation (2005–2018) across ICES areas were 542–715 t (ICES 2019). In the western Mediterranean Sea and northwest Africa, the species is a bycatch of a range of fisheries, with landings of 300 t in 2011 (McCully <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, the species has been subject to periods of intensive fishing in its entire area of distribution since about the mid-1940s, that includes increasing artisanal fishing pressure (Walker <em>et al. </em>2006). In Uruguay, artisanal fisheries targeting Tope with gillnet and longline were significant fisheries during 1940–1980 but severely declined after 2000 with the disappearance of the Tope targeted with longline (Marín <em>et al</em>. 2020). It is still landed as bycatch of several other fisheries; in Argentina, for example, in 2015 it represented ~2% of the 30,000 t of total chondrichthyan landings, that is ~ 600 t of Tope was landed (Chiaramonte <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In southern Africa, Tope is both targeted and a byproduct with catches of 100–400 t annually in demersal and pelagic line, trawl, gillnet, and recreational fisheries (da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015, Winker <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>In the Northeast Pacific, Tope is taken as bycatch at low levels with the main fisheries in which it is taken declining in effort due to implementation of management measures (Walker <em>et al. </em>2006, COSEWIC 2007). Demersal trawl and trammel net fisheries targeting groundfish landed small quantities of Tope in California during 1876‒1936. In response to a demand for shark liver oil beginning in 1937, a gillnet fishery expanded rapidly throughout Californian Pacific waters and south along the Baja Peninsular in Mexico and into the Gulf of California (Ripley 1946, Walker 1999), and subsequently north to Canadian waters off British Columbia (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012). The catch peaked at &gt;4,000 t (live mass) in 1939 and then rapidly fell to 287 t by 1944 with the depletion of stocks (Walker 1999). About 840,000 individuals, primarily large adults, were killed for their livers from 1937‒1949, of which ~40,000 were landed in Canadian ports and an additional unknown number were caught off, but landed outside, Canada (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012). Recent Canadian bycatch has averaged 0.5 t/year and 1.8 t/year since 2006 in the trawl and hook and line fisheries, respectively, with mandatory release since 2011. During 1976‒1994, of 100‒380 t of Tope landed on the US west coast, most was landed in California, but during 1990‒2004 catch levels in California were about half those during 1977‒1989 (Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1993, Pondella and Allen 2008). Landings in US waters for 1990–2016 totalled 840 t, of which 816 t was caught in California (NOAA 2018). Estimates of the catches during a long history of recreational fishing are unavailable (Ebert 2001).<br/><br/>In Australia, the fishing effort on this species is mainly in the Shark Gillnet and Shark Hook sectors of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF). Tope was historically the main target species, but since its biomass was reduced by 1990, it is now a byproduct of targeting Gummy Shark (<em>Mustelus antarcticus</em>), with the take of Tope strictly managed to reduce catch and to support its recovery through a total allowable catch (TAC) of 225 t, closed areas, and trip limits; annual catches are now ~150–200 t (Woodhams and Curotti 2018). Catches across the rest of Australia are much lower at ~24 t annually (Woodhams and Curotti 2018). In New Zealand, catches of this species peaked in 1984 and have been ~3,000 t annually with a current TAC of 3,107 t.<br/><br/>In the Southeast Pacific, catches of Tope throughout the waters of Ecuador, Peru, and Chile are low despite intensive and diverse fisheries, including the widespread use of gillnets of mesh sizes 50–200 mm (Reyes and Oporto 1994, Doherty 2014), which are particularly efficient for the capture of the species. In Ecuador and Peru, there is no mention of Tope in chondrichthyan species reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (Martinez 1999, Anon. 2014). In Chile during 1976–1995, reported annual catches were often zero but increased from zero to 11 ton in 1979, to a peak of 36 ton in 1980, and then decreased to 6 ton in 1992, and subsequently to zero (Pequeño and Lamilla 1997). Since that time, official landings statistics to 2017 include only 1 ton for 2009. As an unimportant fishery product, much of the catch is likely unreported (F. Concha, Biología y Conservación de Condrictios, Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile, pers. comm. 20 January 2020). Visual inspection and DNA testing of landed shark fins in Chile also indicate low catches of Tope (Sebastian <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality are habitat degradation in potential nursery areas that can negatively affect recruitment, and installation of high voltage direct current sub-sea cables across their migration lanes that may affect feeding and navigation (Walker <em>et al. </em>2006).",Marine,Critically Endangered,Triakidae
Mustelus canis,"Dusky Smoothhounds are targeted and taken as bycatch in commercial trawl, gillnet, longline, and some hook and line fisheries. In the United States, an average of about 33,000 individuals were landed in recreational fisheries from 2012–2016. Commercial landings were&#160;318 metric t dressed weight in 2016.&#160;<br/><br/>In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack management. There is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery for which stocks have collapsed  (P. Mejía-Falla and A. Navia pers. comm. 28/07/2018<span class=""st""><span class=""st"">), but at the present time it is unclear how  much, if any, fishing  effort is still occurring in this fishery<span class=""st"">. In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). This species is targeted in gillnets and longlines there on offshore islands including the Los Roques Archipelago and Margarita Island, where fisheries are intense (Tavares 2005, Tavares <em>et al. </em>2009). In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20<span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span lang=""en-AU"">–1,000 m (Port <em>et al. </em>2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those having collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Santa Catarina State, this shark is among the target species in driftnets and gillnets (Walker 1998). In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many stocks were overexploited by the 1990s, however there are management measures in place (Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011). In Argentina, trawl fisheries started to expand in the 1950s and increased rapidly in the mid-1980s (Watson <em>et al. </em>2006). This species is caught in the San Matías Gulf Hake (<em>Merluccius </em>spp.) and the Tope (<em>Galeorhinus galeus</em>) longline fisheries (Elías <em>et al. </em>2011).</span></span></span>",Marine,Near Threatened,Triakidae
Carcharhinus brevipinna,"The Spinner Shark is caught globally as target and retained bycatch of industrial, small-scale, and recreational fisheries using a range of gears, including trawl, longline, and gillnet (Joung <em>et al. </em>2005, McVean <em>et al.</em> 2006, Carlson and Bethea 2007, Geraghty <em>et al.</em> 2013, Jabado<em> et al. </em>2015, Dharmadi <em>et al. </em>2017). It is also taken in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Roff <em>et al.</em> 2018). Under-reporting of the Spinner Shark is likely due to misidentification with the Blacktip Shark (<em>C. limbatus</em>) (Tillett <em>et al. </em>2012, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).  At-vessel mortality (AVM) was estimated as 56% in a commercial prawn trawl fishery and 4–97% in commercial longline fisheries (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2017, White <em>et al.</em> 2019). The longer soak times in the longline fisheries had a much higher AVM (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017). <br/> <br/> In the Northwest Atlantic, the species is among a range of carcharhinids targeted by the commercial fishery along the southeast coast to the Gulf of Mexico. It is a common component of the commercial catch in the north-central  Gulf of Mexico, but is less often caught in the fisheries along the  eastern seaboard of the United States. It was ranked among the top seven coastal sharks at risk from the ICCAT longline fisheries based on productivity and susceptibility (Arrizabalaga <em>et al.</em> 2011). However, the species was only infrequently captured prior to 2010 with only 3 reported captures from 2010 to 2017 (ICCAT 2018).&#160;  <p>In the Mexican Atlantic, the Spinner Shark accounts for a small proportion of the total shark catch in the small-scale fishery catches. The small-scale fisheries in Mexico account for 97% of the country’s marine fleet and take most of the Mexican shark catch, which is substantial and places Mexico among the top 10 global shark catching countries (Pérez-Jiménez and Mendez-Loeza 2015, Oakes and Sant 2019). Spinner Shark represented 0.1–1.4% of the shark catch over three separate studies from 1993 to 2014, with the number of individuals captured in those studies varying from 808 in 1993–1994, to 30 in 2007–2010, and 37 in 2011–2014 (Castillo-Géniz et al. 1998, Castillo-Géniz 2001, Pérez-Jiménez and Mendez-Loeza 2015, Martínez-Candelas <em>et al.</em> 2020, Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al.</em> 2020). The species was reported as seasonally common in the early years of the fishery during 1980–1998 (Martínez-Candelas <em>et al. </em>2020).  Fishing effort on sharks peaked in 1980–1998 but a 35% reduction in  shark catches from 1999 to 2008 led to a reduction in the shark fishing  fleet and effort (Pérez-Jiménez and Mendez-Loeza 2015, Martínez-Candelas  <em>et al.</em> 2020). It has been recorded as a small portion of small-scale fisheries catches in the Guatemala Caribbean (Hacohen-Domené <em>et al. </em>2020).</p>  In the Mediterranean Sea, this shark was a significant bycatch of the pelagic longline fishery operating from eastern Algerian ports (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2005). In West Africa, the demand for shark fin in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, Set0 <em>et al.</em> 2017, Moore <em>et al.</em> 2019). Spinner Shark are among the reported shark catches of West Africa, with the species among those caught in the highest numbers in Guinea-Bissau (Diop and Dossa 2011). By 2010, there were an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels (that mostly take shark as bycatch) operating in West Africa (Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2018). In the Arabian Seas region, fisheries have experienced increased demand  for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result,  effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas and likely has increased fishing pressure on this species  (Bonfil 2003, Henderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;  <p>In South Africa, the Spinner Shark is caught incidentally by pelagic longline, commercial and recreational line, prawn trawl fisheries, and the beach protection program. The estimated average annual catch was 1–10 t from 2010 to 2012 (Best <em>et al.</em> 2013, da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Mozambique and Madagascar, mostly unregulated small-scale fisheries that target sharks, including the Spinner Shark, are intense with 45,805 and 78,787 vessels, respectively operating in these countries in 2013 and 2012, respectively (Cripps <em>et al.</em> 2015, Temple <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;</p><p>  In Southeast Asia, the catches of this species vary spatially and temporally across the region. It was among the top 10 species landed at some major fishing ports, such as Cilicap, Indonesia and infrequently recorded elsewhere (SEAFDEC 2016). In Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, this species is caught by longline, with juveniles a common catch of inshore gillnet fisheries in Indonesia (White <em>et al.</em> 2006, White <em>et al. </em>2017, White <em>et al.</em> 2019). It was one of the most abundant species landed in eastern Indonesia from 2001 to 2006 (White 2007). The extensive loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves are also an indirect threat to coastal and inshore habitats of this species; Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al. </em>2010).<br/></p>In Australia, the Spinner shark is caught in low levels as bycatch in Western Australian trawl fisheries, the Northern Prawn Fishery, and the Eastern Tuna and Billfish longline fishery (Patterson <em>et al.</em> 2018). It is also taken in east coast line fisheries, although it is frequently misidentified as either the Australian Blacktip Shark (<em>C. tilstoni</em>) or the Common Blacktip Shark (<em>C. limbatus</em>) (Harry <em>et al.</em> 2011, Sumpton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Tillet <em>et al. </em>2012). In southeast Queensland, approximately 30% of the total catch is the Spinner Shark, all specimens of which were less than one year old (Gutteridge 2012). While this catch is considerable, the life history of the Spinner Shark indicates that it can sustain high levels of fishing mortality in the juvenile age classes as part of a gauntlet fishery, that is, a fishery that only catches sub-adults and minimizes mortality on the breeding stock (Simpfendorfer 1999, Prince 2005, Smart <em>et al.</em> 2020). Therefore, this level of fishing effort in southeast Queensland is suspected to be sustainable. However, heavy fishing pressure on the adult stock is suspected to lead to population declines (Simpfendorfer 1999, Prince 2005, Smart <em>et al.</em> 2020).",Marine,Vulnerable,Carcharhinidae
Carcharhinus leucas,"The Bull Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is caught as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries across its range with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is mostly retained for its meat and fins. The species is also targeted in beach protection programs in South Africa, Réunion, and Australia that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010, Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011, Guyomard <em>et al</em>. 2020). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters, estuarine, and riverine habitats means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. The reliance on rivers and estuaries by juveniles means that this species faces threats from habitat degradation caused by damming, agriculture, and coastal development (Werry 2010). Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report 2019).<br/><span class=""page_assessment_classScheme_content""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,Vulnerable,Carcharhinidae
Carcharhinus longimanus,"<p>  </p><p>The Oceanic Whitetip Shark is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most of the catch is taken as bycatch of commercial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martinez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species is often retained for fins, and sometimes, the meat (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>,</em>Clarke&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields <em>et al.</em>  2018), unless regulations prohibit retention. Under-reporting of  catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke  2015)<em></em>. At vessel mortality of 34.2% was estimated on Portuguese longlines in the Atlantic (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2012).

Galeocerdo cuvier,"<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Globally, the Tiger Shark is caught is taken in target shark fisheries and as bycatch in commercial and artisanal fisheries. The species is subject to illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing operations and is regularly caught in recreational fisheries. This species is also targeted by shark control programs in Australia (Paterson 1990, Reid&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), South Africa (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Cliff and Dudley 2011), and more recently Reunion Island in the Western Indian Ocean. The species has been increasingly exploited by fisheries since the 1950s (Ward-Paige&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010) due to the increasing demand from the shark fin trade.&#160;Catches of Tiger Shark in directed shark fisheries  have been documented for a number of regions including the western  Atlantic (Hoey and Casey 1986, Berkeley and Campos 1988, Bonfil 1994,  Morgan<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2009, Carlson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012), Brazil (Bonfil 1994), Australia (Stevens&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1982, Lyle&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1984, Macbeth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Tillett&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012), Papua New Guinea (Kumoru 2013), Peru (Gonzalez-Pestana<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2014), Taiwan (Bonfil 1994), India (Bineesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014), and Saudi Arabia (Spaet and Berumen 2015). <br/><br/>The Tiger Shark is a common component of the U.S. east coast/Gulf of Mexico commercial shark bottom longline fishery, accounting for 8-36% of the catch (Morgan <em>et al. </em>2009, Carlson <em>et al.</em> 2012). The fishery catches mostly juvenile and subadult Tiger Sharks, although some larger sharks are also taken.&#160;In Australia, the Tiger Shark is targeted by commercial shark fisheries in northern New South Wales and in Western Australia. The species&#160;accounted for 3 tonne (t) and 5.9% of total catch of the Ocean Trap and Line Fishery in eastern Australia. However, catches by this fishery are probably smaller than landings from recreational fisheries in that same area (Park 2007, Macbeth&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). In the Western Australia Tropical Shark Fishery, this shark was caught as a target species and annual catches averaged approximately 41 t between 2000 and 2004. This fishery was closed in late 2005 (Department of Fisheries 2005). The&#160;Tiger Shark is relatively common in the Indonesian shark fishery and contributed 5.2% of the total shark biomass of catches from between 2001 and 2006 (White 2007). The Tiger Shark is also commonly caught in the seamount gillnet and longline fishery off the west coast of India, where 242 t and 144 t of various shark species were taken during 2010 and 2011, respectively, but species-specific catches were not recorded (Bineesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).&#160;The Offshore Net and Line Fishery operating in the northern Australia catches the species incidentally (27 t in 2012), although mesh size is assumed to prevent capture of greater numbers (Lyle&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1984, DPFI 2012). This shark is also taken in the Southern and Western Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Fishery in Western Australia with a catch of 112 t reported in 2005-06 (McAuley 2008). The Tiger Shark is a bycatch in trawl fisheries although normally in small numbers and there are few records of catches for these fisheries. The Australian Commonwealth Trawl Sector reported a total catch for the species of 4.7 t from 2004-2011. The&#160;Tiger Shark is caught occasionally in the longline fisheries of Costa Rica (Dapp&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), Mozambique (Sousa&#160;2012), and Saudi Arabia (Spaet and Berumen 2015) and by purse seiners in the Indian Ocean (Chassot&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014). Although little species-specific catch data information is available for the Arabian Seas area, the high level of level of fishing pressure in the region is of concern with steep increases in both small-scale and industrial fishing effort between the 1990s and 2000s (PERSGA 2002, Tsehaye&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007, Bruckner&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>In tuna longline fisheries, the species is typically caught in small numbers relative to pelagic sharks and is often not reported. Between 2007 and 2013, an average of 54 t was landed annually by tuna longline boats regulated by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT database, P. de Bruyn, pers. comm. 2015). Tiger Shark represented less than 10% of the total bycatch of all shark species in each of the management zones of the U.S. pelagic longline fishery (Mandelman <em>et al</em>. 2008). In the Panama longline fishery, the Tiger Shark represented 1.6% of shark catches of the estimated total catch of 109,500 t of various sharks since the mid-1980s (Harper <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the Central and Western Pacific, the Tiger Shark is caught in low numbers (0.025 sharks per set; P. Williams, pers. comm. 2015) by tuna longline boats from most countries operating in that region. <br/>The Tiger shark is a common target of recreational fisheries in the United States, Australia, and South Africa. Approximately 96% of the catch in USA waters are released alive. In the New South Wales Gamefish Tournament, Tiger Shark catches were approximately 8 t per year between 1993 and 2005 (Park 2007). Recreational fishing may account for mortality in the Tiger Shark population in other countries, although catches are unmonitored.<br/><br/>Artisanal fisheries and IUU fisheries are also likely to be catching Tiger Shark, however information about landings from these fisheries is scarce as they remain mostly unmonitored. The Tiger Shark is commonly caught in artisanal fisheries in the tropics and subtropics, including in Mexico (Ramirez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2013), Panama (Harper <em>et al</em>. 2014), Brazil (Bornatowski <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pimenta <em>et al</em>. 2014), and a few African countries (FAO 2014). In Bangladesh, landings of 4.5 t represent on average 1.36% of total catch (Jit <em>et al</em>. 2014). There is evidence that the species has been overfished by Indonesian fishing boats at Ashmore and Cartier Islands, and Scott Reef in northern Australian waters. This area had been targeted by Indonesian fishermen since the 1800s but fishing was banned in 1988 and 2000, respectively (Field <em>et al</em>. 2009). A survey in the region showed the absence of Tiger Shark at reefs historically fished despite years of protection whereas they were found present at nearby atolls that had been always protected from fishing (Meekan <em>et al</em>. 2006). The species comprised 19% of the total shark biomass and 7.4% of total catch in numbers from Indonesian and Taiwanese IUU fishing vessels (Marshall 2011).<br/><br/>The Tiger Shark is a target species of shark control programs in Queensland (Paterson 1990, Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2012) and New South Wales, Australia (Reid et al. 2011), in South Africa (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Cliff and Dudley 2011), and more recently at Reunion Island. In Australia, the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) captured 4,757 Tiger Shark individuals between 1993 and 2010 (Holmes <em>et al</em>. 2012) and the species represented approximately 10 to 30% of total catch in the northern locations of the QSCP between 1964 and 2007 (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010). Standardized catch rates from 1964-2007 for the QSCP in northern Queensland showed an increase in the relative importance of the Tiger Shark, from approximately 10 to 30% of total catch. This pattern is most likely due to the move in fishing gear from nets to drumlines (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010). In southeast Australia, the Tiger Shark was commonly captured by the New South Wales Shark Meshing Program from 1950-2010 with approximately 30 sharks per year between 1950 and 2008, representing approximately 10% of the common shark species caught by the program in each of its locations (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011). In South Africa, the KwaZulu-Natal beach protection program has caught approximately 50 individuals annually from 1978-2003. Since 1989, sharks caught alive are released; however, fishing mortality of the Tiger Shark in nets is 27% of captures (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). <br/><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-AU""></span></span></span></span></p><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-AU""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-AU""><p></p></span></span></span></span>",Marine,Near Threatened,Carcharhinidae
Negaprion brevirostris,"<p>The Lemon shark is taken as target and bycatch of artisanal and commercial longline and gillnet fisheries, which are intense and unmanaged across much of its range. It is taken recreationally on hook and line in the United States of America (USA). This shark has a medium-to-high susceptibility to fishing (Pardo <em>et al.</em> 2016, Saldaña-Ruiz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017) and its large size and slow life history suggest it is sensitive to fishing pressure. Historically, the Lemon Shark has been a target species in Belize, Mexico, and USA and reported as bycatch in St. Lucia (Oliver 1996, Anon. 1997). In the USA in 2018, estimated commercial landings were 8,910 individuals yielding 37,593 lbs dressed weight and it was commonly caught by recreational anglers (NMFS 2019).</p><p>Fisheries effort increased considerably in the Gulf of California in the 1980s and 1990s, with an increase in the number of fishers, vessels, and nets in the water; depletion of large pelagic sharks and other species occurred and caused fishers to turn to coastal species (Sala&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004). Off Mazatlan, Mexico, unmanaged gillnet and longline fisheries targeting sharks arose prior to the 1960s (Kato 1965). Artisanal drift gillnets and demersal longlines are common further south in Mexico and there is a single record of this shark at ""Tres Marias"" Islands and Isabel Island in the Central Mexican Pacific (Pérez-Jiménez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Across much of its Central and South American range, artisanal fisheries are ongoing and are inadequately managed.</p><p>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, the greatest fishing effort and largest reported elasmobranch fisheries in the whole of Africa were the West African countries of Nigeria (13,238 t), Senegal (10,757 t) and Ghana (1,902 t) (FAO 2002, Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005). Nevertheless, given the lack of reporting in artisanal fisheries and the large number of nations fishing in African waters, actual landings are likely to be much higher. Overall across the West Africa region, the average elasmobranch catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) decreased by 71% from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch CPUE in the region was 0.68 t/kW in 1970 and declined to 0.20 t/kW in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Simultaneously, the average elasmobranch catch has increased by more than 2.5 times (250%) from 1970–2015. The average elasmobranch catch in the region was 3,312 t in 1970 and increased to 8,329 t in 2015 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). This implies a dramatic increase in fishing effort as the elasmobranch catch volume has increased but the CPUE has decreased.</p><p>In Mauritania, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates increased by 246% over 1992–2015 (23 years). Historically, catches gradually rose from 1,918 t in 1950 to 9,916 t in 1979 then declined to 6,302 t in 1991, then rose steeply to a peak of 17,015 t in 2015 (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). These increases in landings are congruent with the fishing effort that has increased substantially during the same period (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). While effort has been stable, catches have continued to increase. In Senegal, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates showed at least a 30% decline, and maybe as much as an 80% decline, over 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Catches gradually rose from 3,644 t in 1950 to 20,180 t in 1972 then declined to 4,211 t in 1981, then rose steeply to a peak of 23,194 t in 2001 followed by a fluctuating decline to 4,734 t in 2016 (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In Guinea-Bissau, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates data have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 22% decline over the years 2012–2016. Historically, catches gradually rose 6-fold from 782 t in 1962 to 5,001 t in 1997 then steeply rose to a peak of 17,181 t in 2012 followed by a fluctuating decline to 13,485 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). In Cameroon, reconstructed landings of sharks, rays, and skates have been rising since the 1960s but showed a 96% decline over the years 2007–2016. Historically, catches quickly rose from 391 t in 1950 to 2,881 t in 1974 then showed a decline to 712 t in 1986 (75% decline). Elasmobranch catch then rose to a peak of 7,516 t in 2007 followed by a steep decline to 303 t in 2016 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). There are no other estimates of population reduction available from this region.</p><p>Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for Lemon Shark, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many parts of its range (López-Angarita&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016) and may have consequences for population viability.</p>",Marine,Vulnerable,Carcharhinidae

Carcharhinus galapagensis,"The Galapagos Shark is caught as bycatch in commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, both in pelagic oceanic waters and around islands and seamounts (e.g. Camhi <em>et al</em>. 2008, Martínez-Ortiz <em>et al</em>. 2015, Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016). Under-reporting of catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015). Overfishing has depleted the species in some areas; this has been well documented at Saint Paul's Rocks, Brazil (Luiz and Edwards 2011), but is also likely to have occurred elsewhere in places that fisheries are intense and unregulated, for example Madagascar. Illegal fishing in marine reserves is an ongoing issue (e.g. Galápagos; Carr <em>et al</em>. 2013, Schiller <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In the Hawaiian Archipelago, the Galapagos Shark, along with the Tiger Shark (<em>Galeocerdo cuvier</em>), are predators of the Endangered Hawaiian Monk Seal (<em>Monachus schauinslandi</em>) (Meyer <em>et al</em>. 2010), and there have been recent calls for local culls of these sharks.<br/><p></p>",Marine,Least Concern,Carcharhinidae
Carcharhinus brachyurus,"<p></p>  <p></p><p>  </p><p>The Copper Shark is caught globally as target and retained bycatch of industrial, small-scale, and recreational fisheries using a range of gears, mainly demersal longline and gillnet and to a lesser extent, pelagic longline and demersal trawl. The species is taken in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011, Gibbs <em>et al. </em>2020). Under-reporting of the Copper Shark is likely due to misidentification with the Dusky Shark (<em>C. obscurus</em>) and Spinner Shark (<em>C. brevipinna</em>) (Best <em>et al.</em> 2013, Junge <em>et al.</em> 2019). At vessel mortality ranges from 0–36% for commercial gillnets and 0–67% for commercial longline fisheries (Ellis<em> et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>In the Atlantic, the Copper Shark is rarely captured within the ICCAT Convention area; captures were only reported for seven years from 1950 to 2017 and in most of those seven years, fewer than three individuals were reported (ICCAT 2018). In the Mediterranean Sea, the species is rarely reported in landings, with only 20 individuals reported from Algerian waters from 1996 to 2002 (Hemida <em>et al. </em>2002), and six individuals captured in tuna traps off Sardinia from 1990 to 2009 (Storai <em>et al. </em>2011).</p>  <p>In the southwest Atlantic, the Copper Shark is targeted in commercial species taken in coastal Argentinean gillnet elasmobranch fisheries, and although 292 individuals were captured by two vessels within one month in 1993, overall it is considered relatively scarce in the area (Chiaramonte 1996, Chiaramonte 1998, Cedrola <em>et al.</em> 2012). It is also taken in longline and occasionally by trawl fisheries off southern Brazil and Uruguay, though it is considered rare in Brazil waters and is only sporadically captured in Uruguay (Amorim <em>et al. </em>1998, Marín <em>et al. </em>1998, Díaz <em>et al. </em>2004, Lucifora 2005, Rotundo <em>et al.</em> 2019). It occurs in the Brazilian elasmobranch meat trade but is uncommon (Almerón-Souza <em>et al. </em>2018). Díaz (<em>et al.</em> 2004) reported catches of up to 290 individuals of <em>C. brachyurus</em> per 1,000 hooks from a longline fishery off Uruguay.<br/></p>  <p>In South Africa, the Copper Shark is taken in the demersal shark longline fishery and it is taken incidentally by pelagic longline, commercial and recreational line, beach seine and gillnet, demersal and mid-water trawl fisheries, and the bather protection program. The estimated average annual catch was 101–200 t from 2010 to 2012 (Best <em>et al.</em> 2013, da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015, Bitalo <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  <p>In the Northwest Pacific, the Copper Shark is rarely reported (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013b, Liu <em>et al.</em> 2013). There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the East China and South China Sea. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels and small mesh sizes has caused declines in all fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). The South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and since then have remained relatively stable (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015, FAO 2019). <a name=""_Hlk22807790"">Dramatic levels of habitat loss in the region pose a threat to the Copper Shark’s inshore habitats. In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). </a></p>  <p>In Australia, the Copper Shark is taken by demersal gillnet and longline fisheries and annual catches are stable (McAuley and Simpfendorfer 2003, Walker and Gason 2007, Braccini and Blay 2018). In Western Australia, the species is mostly caught within the temperate demersal gillnet and demersal longline&#160;fisheries, which mainly targets juvenile Sandbar Sharks (<em>C. plumbeus</em>) and Dusky Sharks (<em>C. obscurus</em>)&#160;and are now sustainable fisheries due to management measures that have led to measurable recoveries (McAuley and Simpfendorfer 2003, Braccini and Blay 2018). The Copper Shark accounts for ~3% of the landings in that fishery and catches of the species across all Western Australian commercial fisheries have fluctuated from 48 to 60 t (live weight) annually from 2011 to 2017 and are considered sustainable (Duffy and Gordon 2003, Braccini and Blay 2018, DPIRD 2020). In southern Australia, the species is captured as bycatch&#160;and mostly retained in the gillnet sector of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF); the mean annual catch was estimated at 17 t from 2000 to 2006 (Walker and Gason 2007).<br/></p><p>  </p><p>In South Australia, the Copper Shark is taken as by-product and seasonally targeted in the multi-species Marine Scale Fish Fishery (MSF) (Bradshaw <em>et al.</em> 2018, Steer <em>et al.</em> 2020). The Copper Shark catch is combined with Dusky Sharks and reported as whaler sharks. Copper Sharks dominate the reported whaler shark catch accounting for ~80% and Dusky Sharks for ~20% (Rogers <em>et al.</em> 2013); although this proportion was based on only a few observed catches and the proportion of Copper Sharks may be greater (C. Huveneers, unpubl. data 2020). Since 1983, annual catches of whaler sharks have averaged ~80 t per annum but have stabilised at ~60 t per annum since 2012 (Bradshaw <em>et al. </em>2018, Steer <em>et al.</em> 2020). &#160;Regulations restricting catches of popular commercial and recreational species, i.e. King George Whiting (<em>Sillaginodes punctatus</em>) in 2017 and Snapper (<em>Chyrsophrys auratus</em>) in 2019, and a reform of the commercial marine scalefish fishery in 2020, may lead to a redistribution of fishing effort. It is unknown how this may affect Copper Sharks catches and population. In New South Wales (NSW), whaler shark catches are relatively stable with Copper Shark catches estimated as ~2 t per year, which represented 1.4% of the total allowable catch for large shark in NSW (Macbeth <em>et al.</em> 2009).</p><p></p>  <p>In New Zealand, the Copper Shark is taken as commercial and recreational catch, with much of the commercial catch taken by set nets in Haurki Gulf and Firth of Thames, however, it is rarely captured (Duffy and Gordon 2003, Ford <em>et al.</em> 2018). It was the most commonly landed whaler shark in the recreational fishery, with most of the catch released (Duffy and Gordon 2003).</p>  <p>In the Western Central Pacific (WCPO), the Copper Shark is reported as captured in both the longline and purse seine fisheries from 1995 to 2015 in large numbers of 5,713 and 2,710 individuals, respectively (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016). However, the distribution of all the purse seine observed records and the majority of the longline observed records are in tropical waters of the WCPO where the Copper Shark does not occur and are likely misidentifications. Some observed longline records are in southeast Australia and New Zealand and may be records of the Copper Shark, however with the misidentification issue it is not possible to determine accurate catches </p>  <p>In the Eastern and Central Pacific, the Gulf of California (GC) has a long history of artisanal targeted shark fishing and sharks are also taken as bycatch in trawl fisheries in the Mexican Pacific (Duffy and Gordon 2003). The artisanal fisheries in Mexico are the dominant fishery accounting for 97% of the marine fishing fleet (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). The Copper Shark is taken in the targeted shark fishery, although based on reconstructed records, it occurs at a consistently relatively low abundance in the fishery with reconstructed landings estimates of 10–55 t from 1960 to 2014 (Saldaña-Ruiz <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>In the southeast Pacific, in Peru, it is estimated that the combined shark landings increased from 1950 to 2010 and then significantly decreased from 2000 to 2011 at an estimated rate of 3.5% per year (Gonzalez-Pestana <em>et al. </em>2016). The Copper Shark is targeted in Peru longline fisheries but represented &lt;2% of the total shark landings from 1996 to 2010 and was reported to have a low catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of 0.04–1.1 individuals per 100 hooks in northern and central areas from 1995 to 1997 (Gonzalez-Pestana <em>et al.</em> 2016). The species accounted for &lt;1% of the total observed elasmobranch catch in small-scale fisheries from 2005 to 2010 (Doherty<em> et al.</em> 2014). </p>    <p></p>",Marine,Vulnerable,Carcharhinidae
Echinorhinus brucus,"<p>The Bramble Shark has been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in demersal trawl, longline, and setnet fisheries. The species is infrequently reported across most of its range. In European waters, the species is now very rarely reported (e.g. Kabasakal and Bilecenoglu 2014) after centuries of exploitation (Iglésias&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018); any captures of the species would impede regional population recovery.<br/><br/>The Bramble Shark is a major component of the bycatch of intensive fisheries operating off southwest India (Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, 2013). Fisheries employing a number of gear types (trawl, longline, gill net, hook and line) have expanded further offshore into deeper waters as inshore stocks become heavily exploited. In 1999, a deep-water shrimp trawl fishery developed and expanded rapidly; trawler numbers peaked the following year (2000–2001) before declining significantly, although there are still some 300–400 boats operating in the fishery (Fernandez&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;A targeted gulper shark liver oil fishery (operating at depths of &gt;300–1,000 m) commenced in 2002, and between 2002–2008, there was a major increase in landings of deep-water sharks (see Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, 2013, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013). Targeting gulper shark fishing has also occurred off the Andaman Islands and Sri Lanka since the 1980s (Soundararajan and Roy 2004, A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/2019), and the species may also been previously reported from the gulper shark fishery operating off the Maldives (Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2017). This fishery collapsed and closed after &lt;20 years of operation (Ali 2015). Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Bramble Shark to have high vulnerability to demersal trawl in South Pacific Ocean fisheries (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2019). <br/><br/>Deep-water fishing off the Atlantic coast of Brazil was initiated in 1973 as a handline fishery for Atlantic Wreckfish (<em>Polyprion americanus</em>) on the upper slope (Perez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003). However, industrial deep-water fisheries did not emerge until the early 2000s at which point unprecedented industrial exploration began on fishing grounds 200–1,000 m deep (Perez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Pio&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Development of four main fisheries (hook and line, benthic gillnet, pot, and benthic trawl) was intense; the entire area fished for deep-water shrimp species was estimated to be swept nearly twice over a three-year period (2003–2006) (Dallagnolo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). Along the southeast and southern coasts of Brazil, the Bramble Shark was potential bycatch in a bottom gillnet fishery operating on the upper slope (200–500 m depth). This fishery operates across the entire known depth range of the species from this region (200–250 m), and a deep-water gill net monitoring program for monkfish off Brazil reported 4,378 Bramble Sharks were captured in 2001 (Rincon&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). The species has otherwise been infrequently reported in low numbers from demersal trawl and longline fisheries (Rincon&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).<br/><br/>Records of the species around Africa are scarce, with most historic records reported from depths &lt;100 m (Compagno <em>et al.</em> 1991). The Bramble Shark was reported to be commonly caught by handline off Senegal in the 1960s (Cadenat and Blache 1981).&#160;In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004).&#160;Between 1950–1998, there was an increase in, or appearance of, reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). A number of targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005, Kainge&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;</p>",Marine,Endangered,Echinorhinidae

It has also been reported from pelagic drift net, longline, and trawl fisheries targeting tunas and swordfish&#160;(e.g.&#160;di Natale 1998, Megalofonou&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Piovano and Gilman 2017, Crow<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018) and in midwater trawl fisheries targeting squid off the east coast of the United States (C.Cotton unpubl. data 2019). The species has been reported from areas with intensive fishing effort, such as India, where targeted gulper shark (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp) liver oil fisheries occur (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). Post-release mortality for the species is unknown, although at vessel mortality from demersal longline fisheries has been estimated at 24% (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017). Small specimens are likely to be discarded (Hacohen-Domene&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020), and large specimens may also be discarded in fisheries where there is no market value (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>Off southeast Australia, the species has been regularly reported from demersal trawl, longline, gillnet and dropline fisheries at depths of 200–600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160;A semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with medium risk from current commercial&#160;fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has some refuge at depth&#160;(T.

Squalus mitsukurii,"<p>The Shortspine Spurdog is subject to fishing pressure across its range. Like other <em>Squalus </em>spp, it is likely to be taken as bycatch by demersal trawl, longline, and possibly gillnet, and retained (H. Ho pers. comm. 28/09/19).

Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008).

Galeus mincaronei,"The Southern Sawtail Catshark is caught as bycatch in deep-water longline and trawl fisheries (Rincon <em>et al.</em> 2017). From the late 1990s, deep-water fisheries along the southeast and southern coasts of Brazil developed to remove some pressure from depleted coastal resources (Perez <em>et al.</em> 2009). In southern Brazil, the  trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a  period of rapid  expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650  vessels fishing  at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al. </em>2016). Development of  these fisheries was intense; the entire area fished for deep-water shrimp  species was estimated to be swept nearly twice over a three-year period  (2003–2006) (Dallagnolo <em>et al. </em>2009). Trawl effort targeting squid in this area has also been increasing since the 1990s, and there were between 40 and 100 vessels operating in that fishery from 2000–2012 (Arkhipkin <em>et al. </em>2015).

Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers were over-exploited by 2010, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2019). Deep-water fisheries such as the gillnet fishery targeting monkfish (<em>Lophius gastrophysus</em>) there were considered to be over-exploited by the late 2000s due to governance limitations (Perez <em>et al.</em> 2009). In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Argentina, commercial fishing began in the late 1800s, became industrialized after World War II (Mateo 2006), and increased rapidly in the 1980s (Watson <em>et al</em>. 2006). By 1992 there were over 300 coastal trawlers. This number increased to over 400 in 2015, and the number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet nearly doubled from over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 over that time frame.

Rhizoprionodon lalandii,"This shark is captured in artisanal gillnets, which are intense throughout most of its range. In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack management, and there were an estimated 14,000 artisanal fishers there by 2006 (Wielgus <em>et al.</em> 2010). Since 1995, fishers have reported decreased mesh sizes, the addition of hooks to gillnets, and spatial expansion of fisheries and subsequent increased fishing pressure on chondrichthyans (Marrugo <em>et al. </em>2015). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). This species is landed regularly in large numbers in many areas of the country, particularly in the fishery off Margarita Island, and the level of mortality has caused concern there; management measures have not been implemented despite calls to do so (Tagliafico <em>et al.</em> 2015). Guyana fisheries are dominated by subsistence and artisanal fisheries, which have been important since the government ban on seafood imports in 1971 (MacDonald <em>et al. </em>2015). There are artisanal fisheries that partially target sharks with gillnets and demersal longlines that began in the 1980s. There were ~600 artisanal vessels by 1998, and this species is commonly caught (Shing 1999). Market surveys there indicate that this species is still among the most common sharks in landings there (Kolmann<em> et al.</em> 2017). The situation is suspected to be similar in Suriname and French Guiana. In northwest Brazil, artisanal fishing pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). In northeast and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are over-exploited, and other shark populations have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em> et al. </em>2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2014). In southern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are over-exploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). Motta <em>et al.</em> (2005) reported that this species made up more than 60% of shark landings by number at one site in Sao Paulo state between 1996 and 1999.

This hammerhead is subjected to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure across its range, it has no refuge at depth, and it has been depleted in several areas. <br/><br/>In the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, gillnets that   often target sharks have been operating for many decades in   the Gulf of California, Mexico, and have led to declines in pelagic sharks and   other marine life (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Unmanaged artisanal fisheries   targeting sharks including this species have been  operating  around   Mazatlan since at least the 1960s (Kato 1965), although there is a three-month seasonal ban on the take of sharks that has been in place since 2012. Further south in this  portion of the  species' range, intense artisanal fishing pressure exists  with little  management in place, and there are commercial  longline and  trawl fisheries off many areas of Pacific Central and  South America. Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks such as this, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific (López-Angarita&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).<br/><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname"">In the Atlantic part of its range, artisanal   fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America,   and there are largely unmanaged commercial trawl and longline fisheries   in many areas.

Since  1995, fishers there have reported decreased mesh sizes, the addition  of hooks to gillnets, and spatial expansion of fisheries and subsequent  increased fishing pressure on chondrichthyans (Marrugo <em>et al.</em>  2015). Industrial shrimp trawling in shallow coastal waters (operating  at ~20–40 m depth) began off the Caribbean coast in the mid-1960s and  expanded until the 1980s when overfishing began (Wielgus <em>et al. </em>2010). These fisheries are known to catch the congener Bonnethead Shark (<em>Sphyrna tiburo</em>) (Acevedo <em>et al.</em>  2007) and are likely to also capture this species. Effort in this  fishery peaked in 1990 and declined substantially until the early 2000s (<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname"">García <em>et al. </em>2007).  Furthermore, lack of enforcement capacity has led to illegal fishing by  Honduran and Nicaraguan vessels in Colombian waters (Wielgus <em>et al.</em>  2010). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are  intense,  lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed  by  declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015).  Groundfish fisheries on  the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully  over-exploited by 2000;  these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species,  and multinational, with  vessels crossing national maritime borders  (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001).  Despite some areal closures and the  implementation of a total allowable  catch of target species, there is  now a diminished effort and number of  vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em>  2015).

over-exploited by 2000;  these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species,  and multinational, with  vessels crossing national maritime borders  (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001). Despite some areal closures and the  implementation of a total allowable  catch of target species, there is  now a diminished effort and number of  vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em> 2015). There are artisanal fisheries that partially target sharks in Guyana with gillnets and demersal longlines. There were ~600 artisanal vessels there in 1998, and these fisheries do capture this shark (Kolmann <em>et al.</em> 2017). <span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text

were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s  (Vasconcellos   2011). The combination of intense and  unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the  disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including  Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em><span class=""text surname"">) and Daggernose Shark (</span><em></em><em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em><span class=""text surname"">) (Reis-Filho 2016, Lessa   2016), and this

over-exploited, and the congener Bonnethead Shark has been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo 2011, Reis-Filho 2014). In southern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense and 58% of stocks targeted were over-exploited by 2010, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos  2011). In   Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s,  and  many target stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (Defeo  2011). Artisanal vessels fishing in Uruguayan waters increased from 269  vessels in 1975 to 905 vessels in 1996, and after a restructuring in  1997, the number of vessels increased from 393 to 795 in 2010 (Lorenzo 2015). This is thought to be an underestimate as many artisanal  vessels are not registered. In Argentina, there are gillnet fisheries that have been known to target sharks in the past (Chiaramonte 1998), and there are still gillnet fisheries that land sharks in the Rio del Plata (although this species was not recorded) (Jaureguizar  2015). Overall, this shark is caught in a large number of fisheries across its range, many of which are intense and unmanaged, and it has no refuge at depth.</span><br/><em></em></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Marine,Critically Endangered,Sphyrnidae
Mustelus schmitti,"The Narrownose Smoothhound is captured in commercial and artisanal demersal  trawl, gillnet, and beach seine fisheries, which are intense across its  range. In southern Brazil, the trawl fishery began in the 1960s and  entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in  over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port <em>et al.</em>  2016). Artisanal fisheries there are also intense, and 58% of stocks  targeted by artisanal fishers were over-exploited by 2010, half of those  being collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). In São Paulo state alone, there are over 300 small-scale trawl vessels (Rodrigues <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Uruguay, the industrial trawl fleet was developed in the late  1970s, and many stocks were over-exploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em> 2011, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em>  2015). Artisanal vessels fishing in Uruguayan waters increased from 269 vessels in 1975 to 905 vessels in 1996, and after a restructuring in 1997, the number of vessels increased from 393 to 795 in 2010 (Lorenzo<em> et al.</em> 2015). This is thought to be an underestimate as many artisanal vessels are not registered. This shark is highly commercialized there and is targeted in these fisheries (Segura and Milessi 2009, Silveira <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Argentina, commercial fishing began in the late 1800s, became  industrialized after World War II (Mateo 2006), and increased rapidly  in the 1980s (Watson <em>et al</em>. 2006). By 1992 there were over 300  coastal trawlers. This number increased to over 400 in 2015, and the  number of fishing trips undertaken by that fleet nearly doubled from  over 7,600 to nearly 14,000 over that time frame. The overall number of  fishing vessels in operation in Argentina has grown from under 300 in  1990 to nearly 1,000 in 2015 (Dirección Nacional de Planificación  Pesquera 2016). This shark has long been targeted and caught as bycatch there and this practice continues with little management (Chiaramonte 1998, Van der Molen <em>et al.</em> 1998, De Wysiecki <em>et al.</em> 2017). Overall, this houndshark is subjected to intense fishing pressure across  its range that is inadequately managed, and it has no refuge at depth.  Other smoothhounds that are fished are often able to withstand  well-managed fishing pressure, however in other areas that lack  management their stocks have collapsed (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Colloca<em> et al. </em>2017).",Marine,Critically Endangered,Triakidae

In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack  management, and there is also a shallow-water shrimp trawl fishery for which  stocks have collapsed  (P. Me<span class=""st"">j<span class=""st"">ía-Falla   and A.

In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal  fisheries are intense, lack management, and have exhibited peaks in  catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing  (Mendoza 2015).

Further, it is also the most captured elasmobranch in artisanal fisheries off the mainland state of Sucre (Marquez <em>et al. </em>2019). In Trinidad, this shark is the fourth most-captured elasmobranch (N. Simpson pers. comm. 28/11/ 2019). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al. </em>2001). In Guyana, this species is caught in relatively high numbers in the commercial trawl fishery targeting Atlantic Seabob (<em>Xiphopenaeus kroyeri</em>), which does have management measures in place but bycatch mitigation for elasmobranchs has not been implemented to date (Garstin and Oxenford 2018). In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). This combination of intense artisanal and commercial fishing has led to the disappearance of several larger elasmobranch species in the region, including <span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st"">Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>) and Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) (Lessa <em>et al. </em>2016, <span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st""><span class=""st"">Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016).

Cirrhigaleus asper,"The Roughskin Spurdog is not known to be targeted in any fisheries, but may be incidentally caught in demersal trawl or longline fisheries.&#160;The species is reported from some regions with limited fishing effort. For example, in the United States Gulf of Mexico, Royal Red Shrimp (<em>Pleoticus robustus</em>)&#160;trawl fisheries operate on relatively restricted fishing grounds adjacent to home ports at depths of 250–550 m (Stiles&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Reed and Farrington 2010).&#160;The bottom fish fishery operating in the Hawaiian Archipelago targets deep-water snappers and groupers (<em>Etelis&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>Pristipomoides</em>&#160;spp) at depths &lt;400 m depth (DLNR 2019).&#160;Off southern Africa, the Roughskin Spurdog has been reported in very low numbers (annual average catch &lt; 1 t) from prawn trawl fisheries between 2010–2012 (da Silva <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/><br/>The species has also been reported from parts of Central and South America that have undergone intensive fishing activity. Industrial trawling for shrimp and demersal species was introduced in the 1940s and increased rapidly from the 1960s until the 1980s when there were 450 registered vessels (Mendoza 2015). Artisanal fisheries dominate the catch in Venezuela, employing a number of gear types. Deep-water fisheries began in 2000 and have expanded geographically, and some stocks have collapsed (O. Lasso pers. comm. 30/05/2018). Off Brazil, deep-water fisheries along the southeast and southern coasts developed in the late 1990s to remove some pressure from depleted coastal resources (Dallagnolo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Four main fisheries (hook and line, demersal gillnet, pots, and demersal trawls) targeted a variety of species including monkfish (<em>Lophyus gastrophysus</em>), the Argentine Hake (<em>Merluccius hubbsi</em>), and deep-water shrimps (family Aristeidae) at depths of 200–1,000 m+. The species has been landed as frequent catch from bottom longline fisheries, and occasional catch from demersal gillnet and trap fisheries from southern Brazil (Mazzoleni and Schwingel 1999). Fishing activities mostly ceased in 2006, but may return at any point in the future due to the dynamic nature of Brazilian fisheries.",Marine,Data Deficient,Squalidae
Isistius plutodus,"The Largetooth Cookiecutter Shark is rarely caught incidentally in trawl (pelagic and benthic) and longline fisheries. The New South Wales (Australia) specimen was probably taken by otter trawl targeting prawns (not known if taken on or near the bottom or in midwater) (McGrouther 2001). The Azores specimen was taken by pelagic trawl (Zidowitz <em>et al</em>. 2004) and the Brazilian specimens were collected from longline fisheries operating out of Santos in the south of the country. One specimen was retrieved attached to a hooked Blue Shark (<em>Prionace glauca</em>)<em> </em>(Amorin <em>et al</em>. 1998, Sadowsky <em>et al</em>. 1988).",Marine,Least Concern,Dalatiidae
Squaliolus laticaudus,"The Spined Pygmy Shark is infrequently reported as bycatch in deep-water trawl fisheries (Abe 1962) and has been taken by demersal longline fisheries at depths of 700–750 m and pelagic longline fisheries at depths of 60–80 m over water ~1,220 m deep (Ebert and Stehmann 2013). Some taxonomic resolution may be required in parts of its distribution where it may be identified as a different species. Given its vertically migrating behaviour, the species may become susceptible to future fishing activities if mesopelagic fisheries develop.",Marine,Least Concern,Dalatiidae
Zameus squamulosus,"The Velvet Dogfish may be subject to local variability in its susceptibility to capture and likely has refuge at depth. It is infrequently reported from surface longline fisheries targeting pelagic fishes, such as tunas and swordfish (e.g. Piovano and Gilman 2017, Crow<em> et al.</em> 2018), as well as demersal longline and trawl (e.g. Akhilesh <em>et al.</em> 2013, Romanov <em>et al</em>. 2013, Fauconnet <em>et al.</em> 2019).&#160;The species was caught in relatively high numbers in an experimental midwater drifting longline fishery targeting Black Scabbardfishes (<em>Aphanopus </em>spp) off the Canary Islands at depths of 800–1,200 m (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2018). When caught, the Velvet Dogfish is likely to be discarded. Post-release mortality is unknown, however, in surface longline fisheries, the species is likely to be alive when landed (Griggs and Baird 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Velvet Dogfish&#160;to have high or extreme vulnerability to all fisheries in Southern Indian Ocean&#160;and extreme vulnerability to demersal trawl in the South Pacific Ocean&#160;(Georgeson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019).",Marine,Least Concern,Somniosidae
Carcharhinus perezi,"The Caribbean Reef Shark is targeted and/or captured as bycatch in artisanal and commercial gillnets and longlines throughout its range. Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of Atlantic South America, and there are largely unmanaged commercial longline fisheries in several areas. In Caribbean Colombia, artisanal fisheries are widespread and lack management, and this shark is frequently captured in the demersal longline fishery, particularly off San Andrés Archipelago (Gomez <em>et al.</em> 2017). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). This shark is captured in large numbers there off the Los Roques Archipelago, including juveniles and neonates (Tavares 2009). Artisanal fisheries are likely to capture this species across the Guianas, but there are no data. In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos<em> et al.</em> 2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>),&#160; Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>), and the congeneric Smalltail Shark (<em>Carcharhinus porosus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa <em>et al.</em> 2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2016, Santana <em>et al</em>. 2020). In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are over-exploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em> et al.</em> 2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al.</em> 2014). In southern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those having collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). In addition to fisheries pressure, coral reef ecosystems in the Caribbean Sea, which are the primary habitat for this species,  are in decline due to climate change, specifically coral bleaching, disease, invasive species, and coastal  pollution (Carpenter <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jackson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Overall, this shark has very little refuge from fishing, and is at threat from a continuing decline in habitat quality.",Marine,Endangered,Carcharhinidae
Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus,"The Daggernose Shark is targeted along with other sharks, and/or caught as bycatch in artisanal and commercial gillnet and trawl fisheries. Artisanal fisheries are intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America, and gillnets are a primary gear in most areas. In Trinidad and Tobago, artisanal gillnet fisheries are intense and have been in operation since at least the 1960s, and there were around 400 vessels operating in the early 1990s; the government there led an initiative with the help of the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) to develop the shark fishery in 1983 (Shing 1994). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, they lack management, and have exhibited peaks in catches followed by declines, indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). There are no data from the Guianas but artisanal fisheries are widespread and suspected to be intense. Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth<em> et al.</em> 2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al. </em>2015). In northwestern Brazil, artisanal fisheries pressure is high and 44% of target stocks were likely to be overfished by the end of the 2000s (Vasconcellos <em>et al.</em> 2011). The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including this species and the Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>) (<em></em>Lessa<em> et al.</em> 2016, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2016). Demographic analysis indicates that this shark has an extremely low resilience to fishing pressure. The decline of this species is well-documented in northwestern Brazil, with the species having  been commonly encountered in landings in the 1980s and becoming  increasingly rare up to the present. Furthermore, this shark faces threats to its habitat including mangrove deforestation for aquaculture and coastal development and pollution from the increasing human population in the region (Magris and Barreto 2015).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,Critically Endangered,Carcharhinidae

Lessa unpubl. data 2020).&#160;The combination of intense and unmanaged artisanal and commercial fishing in that area has led to the disappearance of several elasmobranch species in the region, including Largetooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pristis</em>), Smalltooth Sawfish (<em>Pristis pectinata</em>), and Daggernose Shark (<em>Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus</em>) (Charvet and Faria 2014, Lessa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).&#160;In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant gear targeting Acoupa Weakfish (<em>Cynoscion&#160;acoupa</em>), Brazilian Spanish mackerel (<em>Scomberomorus brasiliensis</em>) and&#160;Gillbacker Sea Catfish (<em>Sciades parkeri</em>), fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2011, Reis-Filho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). In southern Brazil, the demersal trawl fishery began in the 1960s and entered a period of rapid expansion in the 1990s and 2000s, resulting in over 650 vessels fishing at depths of 20–1,000 m (Port&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Artisanal fisheries are also intense, and 58% of stocks targeted by artisanal fishers are overexploited, half of those being collapsed (Vasconcellos&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011).

Isurus paucus,"<em>  </em><p>  </p><p>The Longfin Mako is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. The majority of the catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martínez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015). The Longfin Mako is likely less vulnerable to shallow set pelagic longline gear than the Shortfin Mako, because its preferred depth distribution is deeper than that of the Shortfin Mako.<a name=""_Hlk531871209""> For example in Sri Lanka, the proportional catches of the Longfin Mako to Shortfin Mako are less outside the </a><a name=""_Hlk531871209"">Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)</a> than within the EEZ; likely attributed to <a name=""_Hlk531871209"">surface longline gear set near the surface outside the EEZ compared to </a><a name=""_Hlk531871209"">longline gear set deeper on the continental shelf edge within the EEZ (D.

In northeastern and eastern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense, gillnetting is the predominant artisanal gear, fishers there report that stocks are overexploited, and other sharks have been depleted (Guebert-Bartholo <em>et al. </em>2011, Reis-Filho <em>et al. </em>2014). In southern Brazil, artisanal fisheries are intense and 58% of target stocks were overexploited by 2010, half of those having collapsed (Vasconcellos <em>et al. </em>2011). This species is caught in gillnets there and in one study from the late 1990s, it made up 18.4% of the shark catch by number, the second most caught species in that fishery (Motta <em>et al. </em>2005). In Atlantic South America, this species is subjected to heavy and unmanaged artisanal fishing pressure, and may be increasingly targeted as a result of the depletion of larger sharks (Almanza Bernal 2014). Although it may have the ability to withstand some level of fishing pressure due to its small size and relatively fast life history, there is no geographic or bathymetric refuge from fishing for this

Squalus cubensis,"There is little information available on catch or bycatch of this species, mainly because there are few deep-water fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. Approximately 490 sharks were reported as bycatch from 2006–2012 in the reef-fish demersal longline  fishery observer data and 91% of those are released alive (Gulak and  Carlson 2013). This species may also be caught in directed  tilefish fisheries that operate as deep as 300 m&#160;and it is reported among the bycatch of&#160;as the royal  red shrimp trawl fishery in the US Gulf of Mexico that operates at  depths of 250–550 m (Stiles&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2007, Driggers <em>et al.</em> 2015, E. Scott-Denton pers. comm. 12/05/2020). Demersal trawling occurs on relatively restricted fishing grounds adjacent to home ports (Stiles&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2007). Observer coverage in the royal red shrimp fishery has also been low (Scott-Denton <em>et al.</em> 2012) and so bycatch information is scarce and reported as presence/absence. Information is lacking on the post-release survival from commercial gear, however, a study conducted in the Bahamas reported post-release survival from research longlines of around 50% (Talwar <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><br/></span></span>",Marine,Least Concern,Squalidae
Dalatias licha,"The Kitefin Shark has been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and benthic trawl, surface and benthic longline, and setnet fisheries (ICES 2006, Walker and Gason 2007, Francis 2015).<br/><br/><strong>Southwest Pacific and Eastern Indian</strong><br/>The Kitefin Shark is taken incidentally in midwater and benthic trawl, surface and benthic longline, and setnet fisheries (Walker and Gason 2007, Francis 2015). In New Zealand, Kitefin Shark catches are generally associated with Hoki (<em>Macruronus novaezelandiae</em>), Ling (<em>Genypterus blacodes</em>), and Orange Roughy (<em>Hoplostethus atlanticus</em>) fisheries, and have been most frequently recorded at depths &gt;1,000 m (Blackwell 2010). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), most catches of this species are from depths &gt;600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). It is likely that catches of this species and other shark species (<em>Centroscymnus </em>spp., <em>Etmopterus </em>spp.) were historically aggregated under a generic code in both Australia and New Zealand (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002, Blackwell 2010). A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species as one of the highest species at risk from commercial fishing that is not managed by the Quota Management System (QMS) (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015), and a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with high risk from commercial fishing (Walker and Gason 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean</strong><br/>This species was previously reported in longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deepwater sharks west of the British Isles and off the Portuguese mainland (ICES 2006), but the gillnet fisheries have since closed and targeted fishing is now prohibited (ICES 2016). Kitefin Shark has also been reported from mixed deepwater trawl fisheries west of the British Isles, although catches were unknown, but presumed to be low. In the Mediterranean, the Kitefin Shark has been caught incidentally in benthic trawl targeting Red Shrimp (<em>Aristeus antennatus</em>) and Norway Lobster (<em>Nephrops norvegicus</em>). This species has likely been previously misidentified with other large deepwater sharks, including Portuguese Dogfish (<em>Centroscymnus coelolepis</em>) and Leafscale Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>) (ICES 2006). Discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sánchez 2017) and the extent of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is unknown (ICES 2016) (see Walls and Guallart 2015, 2016 for more information).<br/><p></p>",Marine,Vulnerable,Dalatiidae
Etmopterus gracilispinis,"The Broadband Lanternshark is captured rarely by longlines and midwater trawls (Amorim <em>et al.</em> 1998, L. Compagno pers. comm. 2007). The amount of mortality arising from this is not suspected to be substantially affecting the population. There are no other potential threats known.",Marine,Least Concern,Etmopteridae
Etmopterus granulosus,"The Southern Lanternshark is taken incidentally in benthic trawl and longline fisheries across its range (Daley <em>et al.</em> 2002, Ebert 2015, Francis 2015). Off the west coast of South Africa, this species is caught as bycatch in trawl fisheries for hake&#160;(<em>Merluccius paradoxus</em>) (Ebert 2015). On both the Kerguelen Plateau and Macquarie Ridge, small catches of <em>Etmopterus</em> spp. have been reported as bycatch in deepwater longline fisheries (Duhamel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997, Zhou and Fuller 2011). It is possible that this species is misidentified and recorded as the Traveller Lanternshark (<em>Etmopertus viator</em>), which is similar in appearance and has a comparable distribution range to the Southern Lanternshark (Straube&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>This species is taken in minor amounts as bycatch in small-scale artisanal deepwater longline fisheries off Valdivia, Chile, which target Pink Cusk-eel (<em>Genypterus blacodes</em>)&#160;(Lamilla 2003), in the Chilean deep sea shrimp fishery, which operates down to depths of 500 m (Acuña and Villaroel 2002), and in the Orange Roughy (<em>Hoplostethus atlanticus</em>) commercial benthic trawl fishery on the Juan Fernandez Seamounts at depths of 300-500 m (J. Lamilla unpub. data).&#160;<br/><br/>In Australia, the Southern Lanternshark&#160;is infrequently encountered, but when observed, is recorded in very large catches, suggesting this species forms large aggregations (Daley&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), most catches are from depths &gt;600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). It was recorded as the most abundant deepwater dogfish on seamounts around Tasmania, making up a large proportion of dogfish catch (&gt;72%) reported from Orange Roughy&#160;fisheries (Daley <em>et al.</em> 2002), most of which have since closed (Patterson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016). The Southern Lanternshark has a high overlap with Orange Roughy and Smooth Oreo (<em>Pseudocyttus maculatus</em>) deepwater trawl fisheries in New Zealand (Wetherbee 2000). It is strongly associated with seamounts (Tracey <em>et al</em>. 2004), potentially increasing its susceptibility to capture. A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species as one of the highest species at risk from commercial fishing that is not managed by the Quota Management System (QMS)&#160;(Ford&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015), and a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with moderate risk from commercial fishing (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).",Marine,Least Concern,Etmopteridae

In the Gulf of Mexico, this species occurs with relative frequency as bycatch in trawl fisheries targeting butterfish                    in the Gulf of Mexico and other demersal trawls in the U.S. North Atlantic Ocean (Baremore <em>et al.</em> 2008, Baremore <em>et al.</em> 2010, McMillan 2009) and it is possible they occur as bycatch in other fisheries. Note that this species<em> </em>is often found in deeper waters where shrimp trawling effort is low. However, the general trend for fisheries to expand into deeper waters as coastal waters become fully to over-exploited means that potential future fishing mortality is a major threat. <br/><br/>Most fishing operations in the southern (Mexican) Gulf of Mexico are shallow, artisanal fisheries and therefore unlikely to impact angel sharks to a great degree. Further information is required on the interaction of this species with fisheries and potential impact of fishing activities on the population given that large declines in other <em>Squatina</em> spp. have been documented where trawling activity is intensive. Conservative life history characteristics could make the species susceptible to over-exploitation.",Marine,Least Concern,Squatinidae
Cephaloscyllium sarawakensis,"The Sarawak Pygmy Swell Shark is a bycatch of industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple gears, including demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet, and is retained, mostly for fish meal. The species is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range. There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of this species. The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>This species is a retained bycatch in deep-water trawl fisheries in the South China Sea off southwest Taiwan (Nakaya <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistic pers. comm. 28 August 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273–12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Demersal trawling operates to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high, and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al</em>. 2013, FAO 2019, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China one of the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is landed as trash fish and used as fish meal and also possibly to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, FAO 2020). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This fleet tends to operate within 4–5 nautical miles from shore (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, FAO 2020).&#160; The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014b, FAO 2020).<br/><br/>Coastal fisheries in Cambodia are considered overexploited (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014a). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 26,180 vessels in 1950 to 108,490 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since the 1980s and most of the fleet artisanal fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The marine fisheries are mostly inshore and small-scale within 10 km of the shore. Motorized vessels increased during the 1980s and trawlers are the dominant fishery accounting for one-quarter to one-third of the Cambodian fishing fleet (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>This species was considered a common species 10 years ago in Malaysia when there were large vessels that fished in the South China Sea. These vessels have since stopped operating and this species is no longer landed in Malaysia as trawlers only operate to a depth of ~80 m (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 1970s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2002, A. Ali unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The gulf coast of Thailand is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of their fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg/hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg/hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014). This likely has subjected the Sarawak Pygmy Swell Shark to increasing levels of exploitation.<br/><br/>Future development in the region, such as the 'nine-dash line' area claimed by China and the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, may enable increased fishing pressure and habitat degradation through dredging and land creation activities (Mora <em>et al</em>. 2016). The recent discovery of their clear egg cases may make this species a target for aquaria in the future (Nakaya <em>et al</em>. 2020).",Marine,Critically Endangered,Scyliorhinidae
Deania profundorum,"<p>The Arrowhead Dogfish has been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and demersal trawl, demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries. <br/><br/><em>Deania&#160;</em>spp were previously reported in trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope of the Northeast Atlantic (Gordon 1999), and was historically exploited commercially. Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in considerable quantities in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). At-vessel-mortality is high, and post-release mortality is also likely to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello&#160;and Sanchez&#160;2017).&#160;In the Northwest Atlantic, there is limited deep-water fishing effort. In the US Gulf of Mexico, Royal Red Shrimp (<em>Pleoticus robustus</em>)&#160;trawl fisheries operate on relatively restricted fishing grounds adjacent to home ports at depths of 250–550 m (Stiles&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2007, Reed and Farrington 2010).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from Black Hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Kainge<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing; deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp are occasionally reported in logbooks (annual catch of &lt;1 t between 2010–12) in demersal inshore and offshore hake trawl fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). In the South African Hake fishery,&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp made up &lt;0.2% of the total catch&#160;with a reported 126 t landed between 2010–<a>2018 (MSC 2020).&#160;</a>There is currently no deep-water fishing where the species occurs off Oman and the Gulf of Aden.<br/><br/>In the Indian Ocean, the species is also taken as bycatch in deep-water shrimp trawl fisheries that operate off western India (Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). This fishery&#160;developed in 1999 and after rapid expansion and rapid decline in effort, the fleet is high at 300–400 boats operating in the fishery (Fernandez<em>&#160;et al. </em>2015). Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2019).<br/><br/>In the Pacific Ocean, deep-water dogfish fisheries date back to the 1960s (Flores 2004). These fisheries use demersal longline gear to primarily targeting&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp, but likely catch <em>Deania </em>spp on occasion (LAMAVE 2017). These fisheries are known for their boom-and-bust nature, given the lack of management, and collapse over short periods of time (~10 years) before moving onto new areas (Flores 2004). Like many of the world's fisheries, over the past 30 years in Taiwan, the deep-water trawl fishery has moved to deeper waters; operations at 300–700 m for most of the year and would encounter this species. However, there is some refuge at depth beyond 700 m and during the monsoon season when the fishery operates at shallow depths. There has been a noted increase in landing rates in Taiwan since 2013, that could partly be accounted for by the increased fishing depth, although that has been occurring for the past 30 years with the increase in landings only noted in the past six years, and improvements in reporting can not be ruled out.&#160;Any&#160;<em>Deania</em>&#160;spp caught in Taiwanese fisheries is likely retained and sold locally (Liu&#160;<em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;</p>",Marine,Near Threatened,Centrophoridae
Carcharhinus melanopterus,"The Blacktip Reef Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small scale longline, gillnet, trawl and handline fisheries that occur in continental shelf waters and those around oceanic islands and reefs, especially those around coral reefs. Most are taken as incidental catch in general reef fisheries targeting teleost fishes. For example, in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef it makes up 1.1% of shark catch in inshore gillnets (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011) and 5% of sharks caught in the line fishery for reef teleosts (Heupel <em>et al. </em>2009). In Indonesia it makes up 0.3% of the elasmobranch catch landed at the port of Muncar (Winter <em>et al</em>. In press).&#160;While in Fiji, Blacktip Reef Shark makes up more than half of the sharks landed in small scale artisanal coastal fisheries (Glaus <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species is also taken in small amounts by recreational fishers in some countries. There is limited species-specific catch trend data available for most countries, however, throughout much of the species' range there are intensive coastal fisheries that are likely to exert significant pressure on the stocks. In many parts of east Africa, and south and east Asian, there are large amounts of fishing effort targeted at carcharhinid sharks in continental shelf waters, and the effort continues to increase. For example, in the waters of Indonesia effort by small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017); and in Myanmar the International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, and the number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Only in locations where fisheries are strictly regulated (e.g. Australia) (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014), where human population densities are low (Nadon <em>et al</em>. 2012), or where dive-based tourism supports protection (Sutcliffe and Barnes 2018) are there low levels of threat that enable this species to remain common.<br/><br/>This species is a common display species in public and private aquaria. It is exported live from countries such as Australia and Indonesia to aquaria worldwide.<br/><br/>The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5 ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.",Marine,Vulnerable,Carcharhinidae
Alopias pelagicus,"<p>The Pelagic Thresher is caught as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martinez-Ortiz <em>et al. </em>2015, Temple <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention. Under-reporting of catches in pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015). The species is highly valued by big-game recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality that has been  estimated for the congener Common Thresher&#160;as 78% for tail-hooked and 0% for mouth-hooked animals (i.e. all mouth-hooked animals survived) (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Sepulveda <em>et al. </em>2015). For commercial fisheries, at-vessel hooking mortality for the congener Bigeye Thresher is high with between 49 and 68% of individuals caught found to be dead on haulback (Coelho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, IOTC 2016).</p>  <p></p><p></p>",Marine,Endangered,Alopiidae
Carcharhinus amblyrhynchoides,"The Graceful Shark is rarely targeted and taken mainly as bycatch in gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries throughout its range, and is retained for its meat and fins. Records of Graceful Shark catches in most countries are scant. Keong (1996) reported its occurrence in fish markets in Thailand. Catches are noted by commercial fisheries in India and Sri Lanka (Compagno 1984), Bangladesh (Haque <em>et al</em>. 2019), Myanmar (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015), Indonesia (White 2007), and Malaysia. Jabado <em>et al</em>. (2015) reported that the Graceful Shark makes up about 1% of shark catch in the Gulf. Moore <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported that this species is also taken in small numbers in fisheries in Qatar and Kuwait. While available data in other countries are limited, we can infer that because heavy, often unmanaged, fishing pressure persists in coastal Indo-West Pacific waters, and because other medium-bodied shallow-water shark species are threatened with extinction due to overfishing (Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2014), the same is likely true for the Graceful Shark.<br/><br/>In northern Australia, it is currently caught in coastal gillnet fisheries targeting Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em>), Threadfin Salmon (<em>Polydactylus macrochir</em>), mackerel (Scombridae spp.), and sharks in northern Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2019), but never in large quantities. Harry <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported that off the Queensland east coast, it makes up about 0.3% of the catch in the inshore gillnet fishery. Previously, it was reported to make up 1.5% of the shark catch by number and 2.7% by weight in coastal gillnets and 0.2% of the shark catch by number and 0.6% by weight in longlines in the Northern Territory (Lyle and Timms 1984, Lyle and Griffin 1987). However, catch levels during the 1970s and 1980s were considerably higher when foreign gillnet vessels operated in northern Australian waters; the actual numbers of Graceful Shark captured were limited, but catches were higher as effort was also higher. Foreign vessels caught up to 17,000 t of sharks annually during this period (Bentley 1996), but ceased fishing in Australian waters in 1986 when the length of gillnets was restricted.<br/><br/>This species’ presence in mangroves habitats means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in parts of its range. For e.g., across Indonesia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><p></p>",Marine,Vulnerable,Carcharhinidae
Carcharhinus cautus,"The Nervous Shark is mostly captured as bycatch in gillnet fisheries with some take in line and recreational fisheries. It has not been recorded from trawl fisheries in Australia (Stobutzki <em>et al.</em> 2000, Courtney <em>et al.</em> 2007, Tonks <em>et al. </em>2008). Low catches are reported from the Queensland East Coast Inshore Finfish Fishery, the Queensland Offshore Mesh Net Fishery, and the Northern Territory Offshore Net and Line Fishery where it contributes &lt;0.2% of elasmobranchs reported in each fishery (Salini <em>et al. </em>2007, Stapley and Rose 2009, Harry <em>et al.</em> 2011). It is one of the most commonly caught elasmobranch species in the West Australian Eighty Mile Beach Gillnet Fishery and the Kimberley Gillnet Barramundi Fishery (Salini&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). Nervous Sharks comprise about 8% of the gillnet catch (by number) in the Eighty Mile Beach/Roebuck Bay regions and the more northern (Kimberley) regions of Western Australia, with the catch estimated to be about 20 t per annum between 2000 and 2004&#160;(McAuley&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). However, retention of the elasmobranch bycatch in these gillnet fisheries is unknown, and thus the number/mass of landed Nervous Shark cannot be estimated. Risk assessments of the cumulative impact of northern Australian fisheries found the Nervous Shark to be at moderate to high risk, with a moderate susceptibility and a moderate to high recovery rank (Stobutzki <em>et al. </em>2003, Salini <em>et al.</em> 2007). The catches in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands are unknown but due to its habitat it is suspected to be taken occasionally in small-scale subsistence fisheries (White <em>et al.</em> 2017).",Marine,Least Concern,Carcharhinidae
Carcharhinus dussumieri,"There is little information on catches of the&#160;Whitecheek Shark&#160;as  species-specific data is not usually recorded.&#160;Carcharhinids are  susceptible to and caught in a variety of fishing gear types,  particularly gillnets and longlines, as well as trawl nets (which  generally capture smaller individuals and species). Fisheries across its range have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due  to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in  traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Jabado&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).  Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal  fishing effort and power in some parts of its range leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches (Mohamed and Veena  2016).&#160;The Whitecheek Shark is taken in a variety of gear  including&#160;gillnet, longline, and bottom trawl fisheries.  The high level of exploitation in its habitat is of concern. For example, in India,  there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with  many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI  2010). Furthermore,&#160;there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the  Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2004).  This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010) and all  Indian states have high numbers of trawlers operating. In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters,  targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in deeper shelf waters (M.  Khan pers. comm. 06/02/2017). In Iran, there is increasing fishing  effort with the number of fishermen increasing from 70,729 in 1993 to 109,601  in 2002 (Valinassab&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).",Marine,Endangered,Carcharhinidae
Carcharhinus fitzroyensis,"The Creek Whaler is possibly targeted, but more likely caught in small quantities as bycatch in commercial gillnet and trawl fisheries, specifically the inshore component of northern Australia&#160;gillnet fisheries (Last and Stevens 2009), where it may be retained if management arrangements permit&#160;(see Appendices in Bensley&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).&#160;The species is caught in inshore gillnet fisheries targeting species such as Barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em>)<em>, </em>Grey Mackerel (<em>Scomberomorus semifasciatus</em>), and&#160;threadfins (family Polynemidae) in Queensland, Northern Territory, and Western Australia.&#160;It is also caught by recreational fisheries (de Faria 2012).&#160;The species is only reported from shallow waters (&lt;40 m) suggesting all components of the population may be susceptible to these nearshore fisheries. Juveniles, which use embayments as nursery areas, may be particularly at risk from gillnetting, which could cause localised depletions. The very shallow habitats occupied by young juvenile sharks make them susceptible to capture by shore- and boat-based recreational fishers.",Marine,Least Concern,Carcharhinidae
Carcharhinus sealei,"Shallow-water demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in Southeast Asia (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006), and this species is unlikely to have found any refuge as fishing effort in coastal waters and on the continental shelf has been extensive. Shark fishing (targeted or bycatch) is widespread, intensive, and generally unregulated across the region and practices are well known to be unsustainable (e.g. Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Dharmadi <em>et al</em>. 2015, Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018). Sharks are captured in commercial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, traps, and seine nets.<br/><br/>In the Andaman Islands, this species is commonly caught in trawls, longlines, gillnets and landed daily with up to 20–30 individuals landed per boat and an estimated total catch of 500­–700 individuals per year (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In Myanmar, it is occasionally captured in the southern part of the country and was recorded in a research survey in 2017 (Psamadakis <em>et al</em>. 2019, A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, this species is fished through the Malacca Strait, Java Sea, and northwestern Kalimantan and most of the catch is taken with gillnets (55%) and longlines and tanglenets (45%), and possibly baby-trawls (Last et al. 2010, R. Yuneni unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort across all sectors has been increasing since the 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s. Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited, and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). Sharks and rays are an important resource and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). Indonesia has been among the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016). <br/><br/>In Malaysia, this species is regularly landed; it is captured as trawl bycatch in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia and common in gillnets and trawls in Sarawak, Sabah, and Brunei (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Across Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 1970s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species was likely taken in inshore fisheries that operate at depths of 5–20 m and use demersal longlines (V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh et al. 2014, FAO 2020a). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020a). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020a). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020a, Helgil 2020a). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020a).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, inshore demersal stocks are considered overexploited with growth overfishing apparent (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020b). Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020b). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3 Gross Tonnage (Palomares et al. 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, demersal trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b).<br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010). In the South China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years, modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds, and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman 2009).",Marine,Vulnerable,Carcharhinidae

These fisheries, with catches an order of magnitude&#160;lower than the Taiwanese fishery (Field <em>et al.</em> 2012), have permitted this species to recover to a stable population (Bradshaw <em>et al</em>. 2013, Grubert <em>et al.</em> 2013). There are five fisheries that target&#160;the Australian Blacktip Shark<em>. </em>The Northern   Territory Offshore Net and Line fishery is the most significant, catching between 300 and 400 t (average 368 t) per year (Northern Territory Government 2014). In Queensland, two fisheries catch significant quantities of this species, the East Coast Inshore Fin Fish Fishery (average 192 t per year) and the Gulf  of Carpentaria Inshore Fin Fish Fishery (on average 146 t per year) (Johnson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Low quantities are caught in the New South Wales Ocean Trap and Line fishery and this species is currently not commercially harvested in Western   Australia, although it was previously captured in significant quantities by the Joint Authority Northern Shark Fishery (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160;This species is caught by recreational and Indigenous fishers throughout its range. The exact magnitude of this catch is unknown but it is inferred to be minor (Saunders and Carne 2010, West <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Hybridisation between this species and the similar Blacktip Shark (<em>C. limbatus</em>) has been detected throughout their sympatric range (Morgan <em>et al.</em> 2011). The number of hybrids in the population appears to be significant (Welch <em>et al.</em> 2011) although the effect of this on population dynamics remains unknown.<br/><br/>The effect of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in Australian waters is uncertain, although it is suspected that it has reduced from the high levels estimated in the mid-2000s (Field <em>et al.</em> 2009, Marshall 2011). This decrease is attributed to higher fuel prices, increased border patrols, and a decrease in the demand for shark fins (Marshall 2011). Although the magnitude of IUU fishing is unknown, fin-based identification of species in apprehended IUU catches showed that&#160;the Australian Blacktip Shark&#160;is a significant component of Indonesian IUU fishing vessels illegally operating in Australian waters (Marshall 2011). Australian stock assessments therefore incorporate a large IUU catch for this species in their models (Bradshaw <em>et al.</em> 2013, Grubert <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>The Australian Blacktip Shark is difficult to distinguish from the similar Blacktip Shark, making accurate catch reporting by commercial fishers and fisheries scientists&#160;problematic. As a result, catches of the two species are reported as a species-complex (Harry <em>et al.</em> 2012). There are three main methods&#160;to distinguish between these two species: vertebrae counts (Last and Stevens 2009), genetics (Ovenden <em>et al.</em> 2010), and differences in the size at maturity (Harry <em>et al.</em> 2012). While the difference in size at maturity can be used for field identification, it only applies to those specimens over 115 cm TL (size at maturity for&#160;the Australian Blacktip Shark) and a large proportion of the commercial catch is below this size (Johnson 2013). Vertebrae counts and genetic analysis&#160;cannot be used in the field. Another morphological technique shows promise for field identification (Johnson 2013) and may increase reporting accuracy, but estimating the comparative proportion of&#160;the Australian Blacktip Shark&#160;and&#160;the Blacktip Shark&#160;in commercial catch currently relies on samples that have been genetically identified (Ovenden <em>et al.</em> 2010). &#160;</p><p>        <br/><br/></p>",Marine,Least Concern,Carcharhinidae
Centrophorus harrissoni,"From the 1970s to 2000, gulper sharks (including Harrisson’s Dogfish) were heavily exploited off the east coast of Australia by commercial trawl, longline, and targeted gillnet fisheries (Graham&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2001, Daley&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Wilson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009). Despite the current zero retention limit, some gulper sharks have been recorded in landings from trawl fisheries in the Commonwealth Trawl and Scalefish Hook sectors (0.5 and 0.35 t in 2016–17 and 2017–18 fishing seasons, respectively); these landings may be reporting errors, but misreporting or underestimation of discards is also plausible based on the degree of overlap with current fishing effort (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). Given their slow life histories, even low levels of mortality can pose risk for the recovery of gulper shark populations.",Marine,Endangered,Centrophoridae
Centrophorus squamosus,"<p>The Leafscale Gulper Shark has been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and demersal trawl, surface and demersal longline, and setnet fisheries.<br/><br/>Where targeted fishing occurs, fishing activity has been intensive. In the Philippines, deep-water dogfish fisheries (<em>Centrophorus </em>spp and <em>Squalus </em>spp), dating back to the 1960s, are known for their boom-and-bust nature and collapse over short periods of time (~10 years) before effort is shifted into new regions (Flores 2004). Deep-water dogfishes, including a number of&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp, are targeted and/or retained as bycatch throughout Indonesia for their high value liver oil (White&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Gunawan 2013, Samusamu and Dharmadi 2017). Fisheries occur at depths of 200–800 m (Samusamu and Dharmadi, 2017), but have also been reported near shore at depths &lt;100 m (Gunawan 2013). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across Indonesia, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in many areas across the Indo-West Pacific (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2006).&#160;Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high, but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). <br/><br/>This species was previously reported in trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope of the Northeast Atlantic (Gordon 1999), and was historically exploited commercially. Landings of the Leafscale Gulper Shark were historically aggregated with other deep-water dogfish (primarily the Portuguese Dogfish,&#160;<em>Centroscymnus coelolepis</em>) in a mixed landing category, referred to as “siki” shark (ICES-WGEF 2018).&#160;Since the introduction of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) of zero in 2010, it is likely that discarding and misreporting of the species has increased (ICES-WGEF 2018).&#160;In 2014, 50% of sampled specimens collected from longliners and landed as the Tope Shark (<em>Galeorhinus galeus</em>)&#160;were found to be Leafscale Gulper Shark or Portuguese Dogfish (ICES-WGEF 2018). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in considerable quantities in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;Discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sánchez 2017) and the extent of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is unknown (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998,&#160;there was an apparent increase in reported landings&#160;of deep-water sharks and dogfishes&#160;across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005, Kainge&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2005). Gulper sharks are occasionally reported (&lt;1 t between 2010–12) in demersal trawl and hake longline fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2015).<br/><br/>In India, fisheries employing a number of gear types (trawl, longline, gill net, hook and line) have expanded further offshore into deeper waters as inshore stocks become heavily exploited. A targeted gulper shark (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp) liver oil fishery (operating at depths of &gt;300–1,000 m) commenced in 2002, and during the period 2002–2008, there was a major increase in landings of deep-water sharks (see Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011, 2013, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013). Targeting fishing has occurred off the Andaman Islands&#160;since the 1980s (Soundararajan and Roy 2004). Reports of large quantities of shark liver oil recently transported out of Somalia may be indicative of developing fisheries in this region (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Leafscale Gulper Shark to have extreme vulnerability to demersal trawl and demersal longline in South Pacific Ocean fisheries (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;</p>",Marine,Endangered,Centrophoridae
Centroscyllium kamoharai,"<p>The Bareskin Dogfish is infrequently taken incidentally in benthic trawl and deepwater longline (Ebert&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013a). Due to its fragile skin, this species may be misidentified with the Southern Lanternshark (<em>Etmopterus granulosus</em>) in poor condition (Roberts <em>et al. </em>2015). In recent years, increased reports of this species from fish markets in Taiwan suggest fishing efforts are moving into deeper water (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013b), possibly expanding further into the depth range of the Bareskin Dogfish. In New Zealand waters, its depth distribution likely provides it with some refuge, as its primary depth distribution is beyond 800 m where trawling occurs less regularly (between 1989/90 and 2010/11, 85% of trawling within New Zealand waters occurred at depths less than 800 m; Black and Tilney 2015).</p>",Marine,Least Concern,Etmopteridae
Centroscymnus owstonii,"The Roughskin Dogfish is taken incidentally in benthic trawl and longline (surface and benthic) fisheries across its range (Walker and Gason 2007, Francis 2015, Compagno 2016). This species is strongly associated with seamounts (Tracey <em>et al</em>. 2004), potentially increasing its susceptibility to capture.<br/><br/>In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), most catches are from depths &gt;600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). This species, and other smallspine sharks (<em>Centroscymnus </em>spp) were previously targeted in mid-slope (650-1,200 m) deepwater shark fisheries (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Northeast Atlantic, deepwater dogfish are taken as bycatch in multi-species deepwater trawl, hook, and gillnet fisheries that target other species with high Total Allowable Catches (TACs) (Dureuil and Jung 2015), and it is likely that this species is also captured. A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species moderate risk from commercial fishing (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015), and a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from commercial fishing (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Across its range, it has been documented that the Roughskin Dogfish has been reported under a generic code (Blackwell 2010), or misidentified with other <em>Centroscymnus </em>species, including the Portuguese Dogfish (<em>C. coelolepis</em>) (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002, Moura <em>et al</em>. 2008, Ebert 2015). The Portguese Dogfish represented the majority of deepwater shark in some European fisheries, including Portugal (Figueiredo and Machado 2005), before targeted deepwater shark fishing was prohibited in the EU (ICES 2016). These factors are likely to underestimate catches of the Roughskin Dogfish. Any discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The Roughskin Dogfish is also reported from Eastern Central Atlantic benthic trawl and tuna longline fisheries, however, further information is not available for catches of this species (Compagno 2016). As fisheries expand further into deeper water, it is likely that the Roughskin Dogfish will be at risk of future population declines in other parts of its distribution.",Marine,Vulnerable,Somniosidae
Centroselachus crepidater,"<p>The Longnose Velvet Dogfish&#160;has been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and demersal trawl, surface and demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries. The species is likely to have refuge at depth; the species has been found to be most abundant at depths &gt;900 m (e.g. Gordon 1999, Anderson <em>et al</em>. 1998) and its peak distribution in the Northeast Atlantic was between 750–1,050&#160;m (Neat&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/><br/>This species was previously reported in trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope of the Northeast Atlantic (Gordon 1999), and was historically exploited commercially. Landings of this species have likely been recorded in mixed categories, including ""siki sharks"" (ICES-WGEF 2018). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured occasionally in demersal fisheries (e.g. Moura&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Discard mortality is unknown, but could be high; at vessel mortality for the congener, Owston's Dogfish (<em>Centroscymnus owstoni</em>), was found to be 80% (Ellis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the East Central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). A lack of species-specific information limits the ability to identify which species are reported from the region. Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005, Kainge<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). <br/><br/>The species is occasionally reported as bycatch in demersal trawl fisheries operating off Chile&#160;targeting Chilean Hake (<em>Merluccinus gayi gayi</em>) (SUBPESCA 2017), as well as demersal&#160;crustacean fisheries (Acuña<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005) and demersal&#160;longline Patagonian Toothfish fisheries (<em>Dissostichus eleginoides</em>) (Lamilla 2008).&#160;It is also occasionally reported from deep-water longline and shrimp trawl fisheries off southwest India&#160;(Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).<br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Longnose Velvet Dogfish to have extreme vulnerability to demersal trawl and longline, and gillnets and high vulnerability to midwater trawl in Southern Indian Ocean, and extreme vulnerability to demersal trawl in South Pacific Ocean fisheries (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2019). <br/><br/>In the Southwest Pacific, the Longnose Velvet&#160;Dogfish is regularly reported as bycatch from offshore deep-water fisheries in New Zealand&#160;(Francis <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson<em> et al. </em>2018). A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species as one of the highest species at risk from industrial fishing that is not managed by the Quota Management System (QMS) (Ford<em>&#160;et al. </em>2018), and a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current industrial fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has refuge at depth&#160;(T.

Cirrhigaleus australis,"The two long dorsal-fin spines make this species particularly vulnerable capture in nets and trawls. The very stout body of this species also most likely reflects a slow moving lifestyle thus making trawl evasion more difficult.&#160;<br/><br/>The Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) operates within this species’ range off eastern Australia and it is a probable bycatch within that fishery. The range of the species in particular overlaps with the Commonwealth Trawl Sector of the SESSF (Georgeson <em>et al.</em> 2015). Although suspected to be naturally rare, the historical impact of the fishery&#160;on the Southern Mandarin Shark is unknown; the fishery has caused significant declines in other dogfish species (e.g. Graham&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001).<br/><br/>Around New Zealand the Southern Mandarin Dogfish is a negligible bycatch in recreational and commercial fisheries, with most records from droplines and longlines, and few from trawls. The lack of records from trawls suggests a possible preferred habitat of deep reefs and therefore a potential refuge away from trawl grounds (C. Duffy, pers. comm. 16 March 2016).",Marine,Data Deficient,Squalidae
Deania quadrispinosa,"<p>The Longsnout Dogfish has been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and demersal trawl, demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries. It is likely to be misreported with similar looking <em>Deania </em>spp. <br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). In Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from hake (<em>Merluccius capensis</em>) fisheries (Kainge&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010) Species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated; on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005).&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp are occasionally reported in logbooks (annual catch of &lt;1 t between 2010–12) in demersal inshore and offshore hake trawl fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). In the South African Hake fishery,&#160;<em>Deania&#160;</em>spp made up &lt;0.2% of the total catch&#160;with a reported 126 t landed between 2010–<a>2018 (MSC 2020). </a><br/><br/>A number of deep-water demersal trawl fisheries, some dating back to 1968, operate in the Southwest Indian Ocean (Groeneveld and Everett 2015). These fisheries target a mixture of high-value crustaceans (deep-water prawns, lobsters, crabs) at depths of 300–700 m (Groeneveld and Everett 2015). Fishing pressure in this region is expected to continue; in 2017, the fishery in Madagascar intensified from 2 to 12 Chinese deep-water trawlers in 2017 without any known management measures (R. Bennett unpubl. data 2018). Bycatch is recognized as making up a considerable amount of the catch, with sharks, fish, and cephalopods comprising ~85% of catch by weight (Doherty&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). <br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have also been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Longsnout Dogfish to have high to extreme vulnerability to demersal trawl and demersal longline fisheries in South Pacific Ocean fisheries (Georgeson<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019).<br/><br/>In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson <em>et al.</em> 2018). A semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current commercial fishing as fishing effort has reduced and the species likely has refuge at depth (T. Walker unpubl. data 2019).&#160;In New Zealand, the&#160;Birdbeak Dogfish (<em>Deania calcea</em>) is one of the most reported deep-water shark species from offshore deep-water fisheries, however, the Longsnout Dogfish is very infrequently reported (Francis 2015). It is likely to be more abundant than currently reported but taxonomic resolution of&#160;<em>Deania </em>spp is required (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2015). <br/><br/><a>Over the past 30 years in Taiwan, the deep-water trawl fishery has moved to deeper waters of 300–700 m for most of the year and would encounter this species. However, there is some refuge at depths beyond 700 m and during the monsoon season when the fishery effort is directed at shallow depths. There has been a noted increase in landing rates in Taiwan since 2013, that could partly be accounted for by the increased fishing depth, although that has been occurring for the past 30 years with the increase in landings only noted in the past six years, and improvements in reporting can not be ruled out.

Eusphyra blochii,"The Winghead Shark&#160;is heavily exploited in many parts of its range, for example the Gulf of Thailand, India and Indonesia (Simpfendorfer 2003). Only one individual was seen in market surveys in Indonesia during which approximately 20,000 sharks were recorded. It is therefore suspected to be severely overfished in this country as most of Indonesia's fishing effort is focused on coastal nearshore areas where it would be suspected to inhabit (W. White, CSIRO, pers. comm. 2015). Recent catch data from India identifies sharks to species level and has no mention of the Winghead Shark&#160;as a bycatch or byproduct species (e.g. Varghese <em>et al. </em>2013). Severe population declines are therefore also suspected as they&#160;have previously been recorded there. This pattern is expected throughout the species' Asian range where fishing pressure on nearshore regions is intense and generally unregulated.<br/><br/>Within Australia, the Winghead Shark is lightly exploited in several net fisheries. Its elongated hammer-shaped head makes it susceptible to a wide range of mesh sizes and therefore it is predominantly caught in gillnets and trawls. However, it is only caught in low numbers in the Queensland East Coast Finfish Fishery (0.4% of total catch; Harry <em>et. al</em> 2011), Gulf of Carpentaria Inshore Finfish Fishery (&lt;0.3% of total catch; DAFF 2012), Northern Prawn Fishery (0.02% of total catch; Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2002) and the Pilbara Trawl Fishery (Western Australia Department of Fisheries 2010).<br/><br/>The greatest catches of the Winghead Shark&#160;in Australia are taken in the&#160;Northern Territory Offshore Net and Line Fishery and has ranged between&#160;10.942 t and 21.356 t between 2007 and 2012. Due to operational changes in the fishery, however, this catch has decreased to&#160;12.786 t in 2012 and this trend is likely to continue (Grant Johnson, NT Fisheries, pers. comm., 2015).",Marine,Endangered,Sphyrnidae

Heterodontus portusjacksoni,"<p>The Port Jackson Shark is caught as bycatch by a range of fisheries throughout its distribution, sometimes in high numbers. Their flesh and fins are considered of poor quality across their distribution. The Port Jackson Shark is therefore rarely used commercially, resulting in most specimens being discarded in all fisheries catching them (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Walker and Gason 2007, Ryan <em>et al.</em> 2013), often alive.&#160;Catch figures are mostly unavailable as fishers do not land this species.&#160;</p><p>In New South Wales, the Port Jackson Shark is caught as bycatch in the prawn trawl fishery mainly off the central coast north of Sydney, but no catch information is recorded (D. Powter, pers. comm., February 2015).</p><p>This species is caught as bycatch in the&#160;Gillnet, Hook and Trap Sector (GHAT)&#160;of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF). As it is not retained, information about catches is only available from fisheries-dependent or -independent surveys of shark populations (e.g., Braccini&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). The likelihood of capture is affected by mesh selectivity, with&#160;the Port Jackson Shark<em>&#160;</em>being less susceptible to gillnet mesh sizes of six inches and lower (Walker&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005). The probability of being caught in the GHAT has decreased as 7- and 8-inch gillnets were phased out in the early 1980s. More recently, the use of 6.5 inch gillnets in the GHAT is also declining as the region mostly using this gillnet size (i.e., South Australia) is frequently affected by temporary spatial closure implemented to reduce bycatch of the Australian Sea Lion. Catches of the Port Jackson Shark within the GHAT are therefore likely to have reduced compared to the 1970s. Although 100% of the Port Jackson Shark catches are reportedly discarded (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Walker and Gason 2007), fishers were known to persecute the species resulting in poor post-release survival rate. This practice is believe to have ceased (T.

A survey of commercial catches from trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries showed that the Port Jackson Shark was one of the four most abundant bycatch elasmobranch species (Jones&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). Specifically, it was the fifth, second, and fifth most frequently caught elasmobranch, representing 7.5, 19.9, and 5.4% of the elasmobranch catches in the trawl, gillnet, and longline fishery, respectively. The size composition of the catch varied across fishing gear, with the trawl fishery catching smaller individuals (mostly 20-40 cm TL) than the gillnet (mostly 50-110 cm TL) or the longline (mostly 55-100 cm TL) fisheries. Observations on catches of demersal gillnet fishers in southern Western Australia have indicated that stocks remain relatively healthy, with large catches regularly made after 20 years of intensive fishing (C. Simpfendorfer, pers. comm., February 2015).</p><p>Although the Port Jackson Shark is a large bycatch component of several fisheries across its range, post-release stress studies have shown that the species is very resilient to capture stress from gillnet, trawl,&#160;and longline gear (Frick&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Frick&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2010b, Braccini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012), suggesting that this species is likely to have high post-release survival rates from a range of fishing methods. &#160;</p><p>In Western Australia, reported catches of the Port Jackson Shark for marine aquaria ranged from 197 to 664 specimens per year between 2008 and 2012 (Fletcher and Santoro 2013).</p><p>Recreational fishers occasionally catch the Port Jackson Shark, but it is not specifically targeted because of its low flesh quality. A survey of recreational boat anglers on the lower west coast of Western Australia estimated that the recreational catch by this sector of the recreational fishery was 273 individuals in the period from September 1996 to August 1997 (Sumner and Williamson 1999), while the estimated annual catch during 2011–12 by recreational fishing from boat licence holders was 2,200 (Ryan <em>et al.</em> 2013).

Mustelus walkeri,"<p>Several commercial, recreational and charter fisheries operate across the range of this gummy shark. The Queensland managed Deep Water Fin Fish Fishery overlaps with the range of this species, operating east of the 200 m depth contour. This fishery expanded during the 1990s but in recent years, entry to the fishery has been limited with only seven licenses currently available (Sumpton <em>et al.</em> 2013). Although the management area of the fishery is extensive, current operators are based mainly in southern Queensland and in 2012–13 only two vessels were active while no fishing effort was reported in 2013-14 (Sumpton <em>et al.</em> 2013, DAF 2015). This fishery uses multi-hook line fishing gear targeting mainly benthopelagic species and ‘Gummy Sharks’ are a component of the ‘shark (unspecified)’ catch, which was a significant component of the overall catch of the fishery in 2008–09 (DEEDI 2009). The 2008–09 commercial harvest of the fishery (all species) was 171 tonnes, but the size of the ‘shark (unspecified)’ catch within that amount is not available due to confidentiality policies (DEEDI 2009). Additionally, Queensland commercial line fishers under L1, L2 and L3 entitlements, of which there are more than 1,000, can fish below 200 m across Queensland waters using 6 hooks per line (DAF 2015). Some Queensland recreational fishers and a limited number of charter  operators also target deepwater species. The catches of the Eastern Spotted Gummy Shark by these fishers are  unknown. Improved fishing technology, increased effort and problems with species identification and logbook records have raised concerns for the sustainability of species' captured across all these line fisheries (Sumpton <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p><p>The Queensland managed East Coast Trawl Fishery operates within the range of this species. Within a broad-scale study of the bycatch of several different sectors of that fishery, this gummy shark was recorded as negligible bycatch only in the eastern king prawn sector, which operates in the south of the species’ range (Kyne 2010). In another study, it represented 3% of the total elasmobranch bycatch (by number) at Swain Reefs (Rigby <em>et al.</em>&#160;In press). It possibly occurs as negligible bycatch in other sectors of the fishery also, but it is generally only off southern Queensland that the fishery operates into deeper outer continental shelf and upper slope waters.

The management area of the Australian Commonwealth managed Coral Sea Fishery mostly lies to the east of this species' range, overlapping only partially. This is a relatively small-scale fishery with with no trawl  effort since the 2006–07 fishing season and eight licenses in the Line and Trap Sector. There was an increase in auto-longline effort in 2012–13, followed by a large decrease in effort in 2013–14 (Noriega <em>et al. </em>2014, Hansen and Mazur 2015).

The species, along with other wobbegong species occurring within the region, is&#160;primarily caught by demersal gillnets off the southern and lower west coasts of Western Australia. Wobbegongs were historically also caught by a few vessels using demersal longlines in the same fishery until the use of that gear was restricted in 2006. The Western Australian temperate demersal gillnet and demersal longline&#160;fisheries mean annual wobbegong catch was about 40 tonnes per year&#160;(range 28-68 tonnes) between 1999 and 2014 and does not show any sign of decline (Department of Fisheries WA Fishery Status Report 1998-99 to 2013-14, e.g., Braccini <em>et al.</em> 2014).

Orectolobus halei,"Commercial fishing is probably the main threat to this species in eastern Australian waters. Observed site fidelity in wobbegongs is likely to increase their susceptibility to fishing pressure. On an Australia-wide basis, wobbegongs are commonly caught in trawls, beach seines, gillnets, lobster pots and traps, by hook-and-line, and also by spearfishing.&#160;<br/><br/> In New South Wales, three&#160;wobbegong&#160;species (Spotted Wobbegong, Ornate Wobbegong,&#160;and Banded Wobbegong) are taken in the Ocean Trap and Line Fishery (OTL), in the fish and prawn sectors of the Ocean Trawl Fishery, and very few in the Estuary General Fishery. The majority of commercial wobbegong catches occur in the OTL Fishery, where they have historically been taken as both a target species by setline methods and as byproduct by other methods (NSW Department of Primary Industries, unpubl. data). The New South Wales total catch of wobbegongs,&#160;combining all fishing methods and fisheries, has declined from about 120 tonnes in 1990-91 to about seven tonnes in 2008-09 after which catches stabilized and have remained around 20 tonnes up to 2013-2014. As a result, the previous assessment in 2007 listed the Spotted and Banded Wobbegongs as Vulnerable regionally (for New South Wales) because of a 55% decline in catches in less than a decade (Pease and Grinberg 1995, NSW Department of Primary Industries, unpubl. data). However, fishing effort reported as the number of days fished also declined between 1990-91 and 2008-09, resulting in catch rate being relatively constant, around 15 kg per fishing day from 1990-91 until 2009. Catch rates after 2009 increased to about 70 kg per day, but are not directly comparable to values prior to 2009 as catch reporting changed from monthly to daily summaries in July 2009. Prior to July 1997, catches from other jurisdictions landed in New South Wales were also included. Fishing effort and ensuing catch rate should, however, be considered with caution because it is coarsely reported as the number of days fished and does not account for the number of hooks used or soak time. Additionally, the historical aggregation of the wobbegong species in catch data until July 2009 is a further complicating factor. Based on species-specific reporting from July 2009, catches of the Banded Wobbegong<em>&#160;</em>ranged from 62-93 kg per fishing day (mean 80.5 kg) and 8.9-12.3 tonnes per year&#160;(mean 10.9 tonnes), showing no declines.&#160;<br/><br/>Wobbegongs are not targeted in Queensland, but have been recorded in low numbers in the bycatch of prawn trawl fisheries (Kyne <em>et al.</em>&#160;2002). Small wobbegongs are sometimes caught by crab pots in Southeast Queensland and Moreton Bay, but are usually discarded (J. Stead, pers. comm., 2007).<br/><br/> In South Australia,&#160;wobbegongs&#160;are infrequently sold at the Adelaide Fish Market. Commercial catches of wobbegong are small ranging ~0.5-4 tonnes, with the highest yearly catch being in the mid 1980s (A. Tsolos, pers. comm., March 2015). In southern Australia, a small number of wobbegongs are taken within the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF).

Fisheries-dependent surveys of southwest Western Australian fisheries reported that&#160;the Banded Wobbegong<em>&#160;</em>constituted 1.2-1.3% and 0.5% of total elsamobranch catch from gillnet and longline gear, respectively (McAuley and Simpfendorfer 2003, Jones&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). The Western Australian temperate demersal gillnet and demersal longline&#160;fisheries mean annual wobbegong catch is about 40 tonnes per year&#160;(range 28-68 tonnes) between 1999 and 2014 and does not show any sign of decline&#160;(Department of Fisheries WA Fishery Status Report 1998-99 to 2013-14, e.g., Braccini <em>et al</em>. 2014).

Thus, the Banded Wobbegong<em>&#160;</em>and the Spotted Wobbegong<em> </em>are&#160;believed to be a major component of those aggregated catches.

Orectolobus maculatus,"Commercial fishing is probably the main threats to this species in eastern Australia. Observed site fidelity is likely to increase wobbegong susceptibility to fishing pressure. On an Australia-wide basis, wobbegongs are commonly caught in trawls, beach seines, gillnets, lobster pots and traps, by hook-and-line, and also by spearfishing.&#160;<br/><br/>In New South Wales, three&#160;wobbegong&#160;species (the Spotted Wobbegong,&#160;the Ornate Wobbegong,&#160;and&#160;the Banded Wobbegong) are taken in the Ocean Trap and Line Fishery (OTL), in the fish and prawn sectors of the Ocean Trawl Fishery, and very few in the Estuary General Fishery. The majority of commercial wobbegong catches occur in the OTL fisheries, where they have historically been taken as both a target species by setline methods and as byproduct by other methods (NSW Department of Primary Industries, unpubl. data). The&#160;New South Wales&#160;total catch of wobbegongs, combining all fishing methods and fisheries, has declined from about 120 tonnes in 1990-91 to about seven tonnes in 2008-09, after which catches stabilized and have remained around 20 tonnes up to 2013-14. As a result, the previous assessment in 2007 listed the three wobbegong species caught in&#160;New South Wales&#160;as Vulnerable regionally (for New South Wales)&#160;because of a 55% decline in catches in less than a decade (Pease and Grinberg 1995, NSW Department of Primary Industries, unpubl. data). However, fishing effort reported as the number of days fished also declined between 1990-91 and 2008-09, resulting in catch rate being relatively constant around 15 kg per fishing days from 1990-91 until 2009. Catch rates after 2009 increased to about 70 kg per day, but are not directly comparable to values prior to 2009 as catch reporting changed from monthly to daily summaries in July 2009. Prior to July 1997, catches from other jurisdictions landed into&#160;New South Wales&#160;were also included. Fishing effort and ensuing catch rate should, however, be used with caution because it is coarsely reported as the number of days fished and does not account for the number of hooks used or soak times. Additionally, the historical aggregation of the wobbegong species in catch data until July 2009 is a further complicating factor. Based on species-specific reporting from July 2009, catches of&#160;the Spotted Wobbegong<em>&#160;</em>ranged from 51-65 kg per fishing days (mean 58.4 kg) and 4.9-9.9 tonnes per year&#160;(mean 6.5 tonnes) and showed no declines.&#160;<br/><br/>Wobbegongs are not targeted in Queensland, but<em>&#160;</em>have been recorded in low numbers in the bycatch of prawn trawl fisheries (Kyne <em>et al.</em> 2002).

Pristiophorus nudipinnis,"The Southern Sawshark is commonly taken as retained byproduct in the Shark Gillnet Sector and Commonwealth Trawl Sector of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery; the species is rarely directly targeted. The largest impact on the population of Southern Sawshark is their capture and retention as byproduct from targeting Gummy Shark (<em>Mustelus antarcticus</em>) with gillnets of 6–6½-inch mesh-size off Victoria and, to a less extent, Tasmania and South Australia (Walker 1999). During 1970–2006, the catch of sawshark (<em>P. cirratus</em> and <em>P. nudipinnis</em> combined) from the Shark Gillnet Sector varied 43–359 t carcass mass (headed and eviscerated with all fins attached) (Walker and Gason 2009).<br/><br/>The mean annual catch of the Southern Sawshark from fishing methods other than shark gillnetting in the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery for the period 2000–06 estimated by combining monitoring data from scientific on-board observers and mandatory catch and effort returns submitted by commercial fishing operators is 276 t whole mass of which 93% is retained for marketing and 7% discarded.

Scymnodon plunketi,"Plunket's Shark is taken incidentally in benthic trawl and longline fisheries across its range (Walker and Gason 2007, Ebert 2015, Francis 2015). In New Zealand, there is high distribution overlap (&gt;60%) with fishing areas (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015). On Chatham Rise (New Zealand), of the large deepwater sharks, this species had the narrowest depth range, with most catches between 500-800 m, and was considered most at risk from fishing (Dunn <em>et al</em>. 2013). Plunket's Shark is strongly associated with seamounts (Tracey <em>et al</em>. 2004), potentially increasing its susceptibility to capture. It is likely that this species is misidentified with other deepwater sharks (Griggs and Baird 2013), which may underestimate catches.<br/><br/>In Australia, Plunket's Shark is infrequently encountered, but when observed, is recorded in very large catches, suggesting this species forms large aggregations (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002). This species, and other smallspine sharks (<em>Centroscymnus </em>spp) were previously targeted in mid-slope (650-1,200 m) deepwater shark fisheries (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), most catches are from depths &gt;600 m and were retained (70%) (Walker and Gason 2007).<br/><br/>A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species moderate-high risk from commercial fishing (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2015), and a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with high risk from commercial fishing (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2008).",Marine,Vulnerable,Somniosidae
Rhizoprionodon acutus,"<p>The Milk Shark is caught globally as target and bycatch in industrial, small-scale, and recreational fisheries by multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, trawl, hook and line, and longline.

Commercial at-vessel-mortality (AVM) has only been reported for this species in trawl fisheries where it is highly variable ranging from 29–82% in the Indian Ocean and North Australia, respectively (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Atlantic, this species is heavily fished throughout its range and frequently caught in Cape Verde, Mauritania, Senegal,  Gambia, Guinea Bissau, and Guinea (Diop and Dossa 2011). It is the most commonly caught shark landed at fishing sites along the Senegalese coast (Capape <em>et al.</em> 2006, Ba <em>et al.</em> 2015). The predominance of juvenile Milk Shark in landings during all seasons could be an indication that the species is overexploited in Senegalese waters (Ba <em>et al.</em> 2013). It is among the most commonly caught shark by artisanal fisheries in the waters of Mauritania (Valadou <em>et al. </em>2006). In the Banc d’Arguin National Park (Mauritania) 70–85% of individuals caught from April to June are females, more than half of which are pregnant with fully-developed embryos (Diop and Dossa 2011); this suggests that fishers target a pupping aggregation in this region. Declines in coastal shark assemblages have been reported throughout the   eastern Atlantic region, although recreational fishers in the Bijagos   Archipelago (Guinea-Bissau) have noticed an increased abundance of Milk   Shark that has been attributed to declines in the numbers of large,   predatory sharks (Diop and Dossa 2011). <strong></strong> <br/></p><p>In South African waters, the Milk Shark is caught incidentally by prawn trawl fisheries. The estimated annual catch of the Milk Shark in trawl fisheries of South Africa was &lt;1 tonne for 2010–2012 (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). The species is also important to recreational fisheries and was the second most commonly caught shark (18% of total catch) in the Kwa-Zulu Natal competitive shore fishery from 1977 to 2000 (Pradervand 2007). Van der Elst (1979) hypothesized that an increase in abundance of small sharks, including the Milk Shark, in the Kwa-Zulu Natal recreational fishery was due to the removal of large, predatory sharks by the Natal Sharks Board protective gillnet program.&#160;Extensive artisanal fisheries operate in coastal waters of the southwestern Indian Ocean (Le Manach <em>et al.</em> 2012, Benkenstein 2013, Cripps <em>et al.</em>  2015). It is an important component of commercial and artisanal shark  fisheries in mainland Tanzania and&#160;Zanzibar where it has been recorded  as the most abundant in market surveys (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2002,  Schaeffer 2004). The species is also an important component of artisanal  shark fisheries in Madagascar waters (Robinson and Sauer 2013). </p><p>  </p><p>In the Arabian Seas region, surveys of fish markets and landings sites have revealed this species&#160;to be a major part of elasmobranch landings, often as bycatch in gillnet fisheries (Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2007, Moore <em>et al.</em> 2012, Moore and Peirce 2013, Jabado <em>et al. </em>2015, Spaet and Berumen 2015). The high level of exploitation on its habitat in the region is of concern.&#160;For example,&#160;in Eritrea&#160;catch and effort data showed that total fishing effort as well as total annual catch increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002 (Tsehaye&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). <a name=""_Hlk31633737"">While no accurate numbers are available, there has been an uncontrolled expansion of industrial trawling in the Red Sea through licenses issued to foreign industrial trawlers (particularly off Yemen) which has resulted in the depletion of marine resources (PERSGA 2002).

Rhizoprionodon taylori,"The Australian Sharpnose Shark is one of the common bycatch shark species in gillnets used in the Queensland East Coast Inshore Finfish Fishery (ECIFF); it accounts for 6.9% (by number) of the shark and ray catch with a catch per unit effort of 0.2–0.3 (number of individuals km-net-hour<sup>-1</sup>) (Harry <em>et al.</em> 2011, Harry <em>et al.</em> 2016). Due to its small size, mostly adults are captured in the ECIFF but the harvest rate is low and sustainable (Harry <em>et al.</em> 2016). During the late 1970s and early 1980s in the waters off the Northern Territory this species made up about 0.5% of the catch in gillnet and longline fisheries (Stevens 1999). Observer data from the current Northern Territory Offshore Net and Line fishery indicated that this species still comprised a very small percentage of the catch, &lt;0.5% (G. Johnson, NT Fisheries, pers. comm., 2015). It is considered too small for retention (Last and Stevens 2009) and many of the animals discarded in these fisheries are already deceased.

In the western part of the species' distribution in the Great Australian Bight (GAB), the trawl fishery operates mostly on the top of the continental shelf rather than the deeper slope regions, and the fishing pressure on the Greeneye Spurdog has been less intensive in that area. The current fishing effort in the GAB is mostly low (Patterson <em>et al.</em> 2017). Mean annual catch for the period 2000–06 estimated by combining monitoring data from scientific on-board observers and mandatory catch and effort returns submitted by commercial fishing operators was 212 t.

Squalus megalops,"The Shortnose Spurdog is taken as target and bycatch by commercial trawl, Danish seine, longline, and gillnet, although most are too small to be enmeshed by gillnets (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005). A risk assessment indicated that the Shortnose  Spurdog is potentially highly susceptible to the cumulative effects across these fishing methods due to its  low biological productivity and possibly its catch susceptibility (Braccini <em>et al.</em> 2006b).<br/><br/>Fishery-independent surveys indicated it was a major component of  the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) trawl catch between the years 1976/77 and 1996/97 on the east coast (Graham <em>et al.</em>  2001). Along the south coast, trawl grounds in the SESSF are  mainly away from the areas  inhabited by the Shortnose Spurdog, and  selectivity data indicated that  the legal minimum 6-inch mesh sizes  used in the commercial gillnets of the SESSF take relatively low numbers of this  species (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005). Since the late 1990s, target and bycatch landings in the SESSF have generally decreased as a result of managed reductions in fishing effort, gear changes to mitigate bycatch, and implementation of spatial closures and total allowable catches (TAC) to allow recovery of deep-water sharks (Helidoniotis <em>et al. 2</em>018, AFMA 2019). The mean annual catch estimated for 2000/06 by onboard observers and weighted by fishing effort to the entire SESSF fleet was 719 t of which 72% was discarded (Walker and Gason 2007). The 2017/18 TAC for deep-water sharks (including Shortnose Spurdog) was 260 t with the catch in 2017 of 100 t less than half of the TAC (AFMA 2018). The Shortnose Spurdog has been commonly discarded in the SESSF, both historically and in recent years, due to its small size and low value compared to the target teleosts (Graham <em>et al. </em>2001, Braccini <em>et al. </em>2012, Tuck <em>et al. </em>2013). Post-release survival from gillnets in the SESSF is very high at 87% (Braccini <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>The Shortnose Spurdog is  a very minor component of the temperate  Western Australia demersal  gillnet fishery (probably less than 1 t/year). This fishery only operates  to the inshore limit of the species'  range (i.e. to around 100 m depth)  and there is a large area off the northwest coast that is closed to  shark fishing. Catches are hard  to ascertain as dogfish are generally  not retained and not identified  to species level. It is also a minor component of  the  discarded bycatch in the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery   (deep-water component  of the eastern king prawn sector; Rigby <em>et al. </em>2016)  and is possibly taken as bycatch in the Queensland Deepwater Fin  Fish  Fishery that uses dropline and trotlines, where dogfishes have been   recorded but not identified to species level (Sumpton <em>et al.</em> 2013).

Squalus montalbani,"<p>The Philippine Spurdog is caught incidentally in various fisheries. Almost all trawlable ground on the upper continental slope off  central and southern New South Wales (NSW) is regularly fished by multigear  and multispecies fisheries in the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and  Shark Fishery (SESSF) (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). There is relatively little fishing effort&#160;in deep water off northern NSW, Queensland, and off Western Australia, suggesting that threat levels are low throughout most of its&#160;Australian range. Although the effort is relatively minimal in Queensland, the species is possibly taken as bycatch in the Queensland Deepwater Fin Fish Fishery that uses droplines and trotlines, where dogfishes have been record but not identified to species (Sumpton <em>et al</em>. 2013). In southern Queensland, a developmental deepwater trawl fishery at 250–800 m may take the Philippine Spurdog as bycatch (Department of Environment 2016).<br/><br/>The species is frequently caught by deepwater demersal longline fisheries off parts of Indonesia (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006a) and the Philippines (Gaudiano and Alava 2003, Flores 2004).

Off the Philippines, mostly gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;spp.) are caught, with Philippine Spurdog forming a relatively small part of the catch (Flores 2004). The potential expansion of long-lining into depths greater than the current&#160;maximum of ~600 m will further increase the fishing pressure on the species&#160;by exploiting that portion of the population previously afforded refuge at greater depths.

Parmaturus xaniurus,"This species is not presently targeted by commercial fisheries or utilized for human consumption, but is caught as incidental catch in sablefish trap, longline and bottom trawl fisheries. Specific catch data are not available.<br/><br/>Trawl fisheries have operated between 20-2,000 m depth, which is throughout the depth range of this species. However, adults primarily inhabit areas of rocky vertical relief (mostly in depths of 300 to 600 m) which act as a natural refuge from trawl fisheries. This is also true for egg cases, which are often deposited in rocky environments. Egg cases of the Filetail Catshark are susceptible to predation by Thornyhead Rockfishes (<em>Sebastolobus</em>&#160;spp.), sea stars, and boring gastropods. The longline fisheries in the range of this species generally operate anywhere from 50 to 550 m. Longlines are laid over the rocky areas and are far more likely to catch adults of this species on a regular basis, as well as juveniles (which use the midwater area as a nursery). Purse seines targeting the market squid&#160;<em>Loligo opalescens </em>operate in midwater environments within the range of this species, and while they have the potential to impact the Filetail Catshark, there are no reports of bycatch of this species in this fishery.<br/><br/>In Mexico, artisanal trawl and gillnet fisheries did not encounter the Filetail Catshark when surveys were conducted in fishing communities along the coast of mainland Sonora from 1998 to 1999. The authors considered this species to be outside of the reach of these fisheries (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009a). However, little information is known and the situation in Mexico needs to be monitored.<br/><br/>In the United States, fishing pressure is thought to be unlikely to increase in the near future. Most of the trawling operations along the west coast of the United States are becoming more limited and are heavily restricted. As long as there are limits on rockfish fisheries, there will be limited groundfishing in these waters.",Marine,Least Concern,Pentanchidae
Mustelus californicus,"In the USA this species is regularly caught by recreational anglers in southern California and is of little economic value (Ebert 2003). The California Department of Fish and Wildlife reports &lt;1 metric tonne of Grey Smooth-hound being landed by the commercial fisheries in 2013 (California Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2014).<br/>The majority of the fishing pressure on Gray Smooth-hound occurs in Mexico, specifically in the Gulf of California. In Baja California,&#160;<em>Mustelus</em> species have been caught by the artisanal fishing fleet in the northern Gulf of California since the 1980s (Cudney and Turk 1998) and by the medium size trawl fleet since 1996, when 59 shrimp trawler vessels obtained fishing permits to catch finfish and elasmobranch species out of the shrimp fishing season. When they are not being targeted, they are taken as bycatch by the shrimp trawl fleet (Sustentabilidad y Pesca Responsible en México: Evaluación y manejo 1997-1998). No catch data are available but these trawl vessels operate in shallow waters where this species is present. In addition to trawl vessels, this species is frequently targeted with bottom gill-nets&#160;(4-6 inches mesh size)&#160;in the northern Gulf of California from March to July, especially when most valuable teleost species are not abundant. Neonates are not thought to be vulnerable to the gill-nets used because they are smaller than the mesh size (4, 6, 8 inches) in this area. In this region the catches can be as high as 500 kg per fishing trip. In the Baja California Sur, this species is commonly caught in the southern Gulf of California by medium size trawl vessels&#160;that target finfish and elasmobranchs from April to July (at depths shallower than 100 m), and is bycatch in the shrimp fishery from September to January (Pérez-Jiménez 2006).",Marine,Least Concern,Triakidae
Mustelus henlei,"Interest to commercial United States fisheries is likely negligible, and there is no directed fishery for this smoothhound at this time.<br/><br/>In the United States the majority of annual landings are a result of bycatch from fisheries targeting other species within the region, such as California halibut (Ebert 2003). Recreational anglers are the primary source of landings for the species in San Francisco Bay and elsewhere along the coast, but not in significant numbers (Ebert 2003).<br/><br/>In the northern Gulf of California, Mexico, <em>Mustelus</em> species have been caught by the artisanal fleet since the 1980s (Cudney and Turk 1998) and by medium size trawler vessels since 1996, when 59 shrimp trawler vessels obtained fishing permits to catch finfish and elasmobranch species during the non-shrimp fishing season. The species is very commonly caught by the artisanal fishery in the upper Gulf of California, which targets ""Baqueta"" (<em>Epinephelus acanthistius</em>) using bottom set longlines. It is sometimes quite abundant in these catches from November to March (Cudney and Turk 1998). In this region it is less commonly caught in bottom gill-nets. This small shark species is also caught as bycatch, although it is believed that only small numbers are caught because the trawling operations for catching shrimp are shallower than the main distribution area of this small shark species (Sustentabilidad y Pesca Responsible en México: Evaluación y manejo 1997-1998).<br/><br/>Marquez-Farias (2000) stated that in the Sonora state (northeastern Gulf of California) the Brown Smoothhound was the most abundant shark species caught with gill-nets by the artisanal fishery at depths &gt;80 m. This mainly occurs during the autumn and winter months when this, and other small shark species (<em>Rhizoprionodon longurio</em>, <em>M. lunulatus</em> and <em>M. californicus</em>), make seasonal migrations. During this period, catch rates as high as 1,200-1,500 individuals per fishing trip have been reported. In the Pacific, off Santa Rosalillita, Baja California (approximately 400 km south of Ensenada) there are high catch rates of <em>Mustelus</em> species (possibly mainly <em>M. californicus</em> and <em>M. henlei</em>). During the period from May to September of 2001, 4,638 kg of <em>Mustelus</em> species were caught (Rodríguez-Medrano and Almeda-Jauregui 2002).<br/><br/>Various fisheries (mainly artisanal) along the coasts of Ecuador and Peru land sharks, including houndsharks, as bycatch. In some cases sharks have been specifically targeted, however target fisheries for sharks were prohibited in Ecuador in 2004.",Marine,Least Concern,Triakidae
Mustelus lunulatus,"In the northern Gulf of California, <em>Mustelus</em> species have been caught by the artisanal fleet since the 1980s (Cudney and Turk 1998). This species is also targeted and caught as bycatch in medium size trawl vessels, which have operated since 1996 (Sustentabilidad y Pesca Responsible en México: Evaluación y manejo 1997-1998). These 59 shrimp trawler vessels obtained fishing permits to target finfish and elasmobranch species from April to May (at depths of less than 100 m), and they also catch this species as bycatch from September to January (Pérez-Jiménez 2006). Although no data are available on the magnitude of catches, this species may be frequently caught because the shrimp fishery operates within this species' depth range. Off the coast of Nayarit state, Mexico, fisheries operating in the Tres Marias Islands reported to target this species using longlines and gillnets, and often also encountered this shark as bycatch when targeting larger sharks (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 2005). Despite continuing fishing pressure, there is no evidence to suggest that this species has declined. Artisanal fishing communities travel long distances (up to 180 km) in order to locate smoothhounds, which are targeted by fishing communities primarily in the summer months (Moreno-Báez <em>et al</em>. 2010). They are also targeted within existing marine protected areas using gill nets or long lines (Moreno-Báez <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>The Sicklefin Smoothhound is also taken as bycatch in drift gillnets in Guatemala, and off Colombia in shrimp trawl bycatch.",Marine,Least Concern,Triakidae
Triakis semifasciata,"Leopard Sharks appear to be primarily caught in Californian waters. The commercial and recreational catch of leopard sharks in the extreme northerly part of its range in Oregon is thought to be negligible (Emmett <em>et al</em>. 1991, Pacific Fisheries Information Network (<a href=""http://pacfin.psmfc.org"">PacFIN</a>), Recreational Fisheries Information Network (<a href=""http://www.recfin.org/"">RecFIN</a>)).<br/><br/>In California, where nearly all of the U.S. harvest occurs, the leopard shark is taken primarily by recreational anglers. The recreational leopard shark catch is much more extensive than the commercial catch for this species. Leopard sharks have been recreationally harvested by angling with baited hooks from piers, jetties, beaches, banks and skiffs, bow fishing in shallow waters, and spearfishing by divers. Estimated recreational landings in California between 1980 and 1995, for years when data were collected, averaged over 138 metric tons (mt) annually. After a peak in 1987 of around 546 mt, recreational landings declined and from the mid 1990’s to 2006 remained relatively lower and stable at around 46 mt (<a href=""http://pacfin.psmfc.org"">PacFIN</a>, Smith and Horeczko 2006). Since 2006, recreational catch has decreased from prior levels (<a href=""http://www.recfin.org/"">RecFIN</a>).<br/><br/>Commercially, leopard sharks are taken incidentally in gillnet, longline and trawl fisheries although there is a small targeted hook-and-line fishery in San Francisco Bay (Smith and Horeczko 2006). A problem exists in accurately judging the extent of the commercial harvest because an unknown portion of the commercial catch may be landed under the general category ‘shark, unspecified’ and different species are often marketed under the generic name “shark.” California commercial landings specifically reported under the ‘Leopard Shark' category are relatively minor, and have ranged from 4.2 mt in 1958 to a high of 46 mt in 1983. Catches declined after 1983 and from the mid 1990’s to 2007 remained relatively low and stable, at around 11.4 mt. Landings dropped after 2008 and have remained low at around 2.3 mt per year since (http://pacfin.psmfc.org).&#160; Curtailment of inshore gillnetting probably contributed greatly to the decline in California landings. The species has also been harvested for the cold-water aquarium trade and is highly prized for its distinctive markings and hardiness (Smith and Horeczko 2006).<br/><br/>Loss and alteration of habitat, especially in coastal bays and estuaries, is of great concern for this species, given the importance of these areas for foraging and as nursery sites (Carlisle and Starr 2009). Water quality in bays and estuaries is of potential concern as well. For example, Elkhorn Slough, an important foraging and nursery area for this species, has experienced severe nutrient loading from surrounding agricultural areas, resulting in eutrophication and hypoxic conditions, which impact habitat and prey availability (Hughes et al. 2013). This is a potential problem as there is evidence that dissolved oxygen levels may influence habitat availability of this species (Carlisle and Starr 2009). Leopard sharks have also been shown to have significant concentrations of contaminants in their tissues, but the impact of this on their fitness remains unknown (Schaffer <em>et al</em>. 2006, Carlisle <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Resident stocks near large population centres may be particularly vulnerable to heavy localized fishing pressure due to the limited exchange among regional stocks (Smith and Abramson 1990, Lewallen <em>et al</em>. 2007, Barker <em>et al</em>. 2015). Even though the commercial catch may be under-estimated because of reporting problems, this species does not appear to be at risk judging by the combined landings in relation to previously calculated estimates of fishing mortality (mean F=0.084) and exploitation rates (mean E=0.075; Smith and Abramson 1990). Additionally, current fisheries management measures appear to have reduced these rates.<br/><br/>Poaching of pups for the aquarium trade has been a significant problem. In 2006, several individuals were arrested for illegally harvesting Leopard Shark pups for the aquarium trade. Investigators estimated that between 20,000 to 25,000 pups were poached from San Francisco Bay and 30,000 to 33,000 pups were poached from southern California between 1992 and 2003. This level of harvest is quite large when compared to recreational and commercial fishery Leopard Shark landings, with potentially important ramifications to Leopard Shark populations (Smith and Horeczko 2006).<br/><br/>Little is known of the biology and full extent of harvest of this species in Mexican waters, but it is estimated that less than one percent of the catch off the Pacific coast of Baja California is comprised of this species (Cartamil <em>et al</em>. 2011) and most of the shark catch in the central Gulf of California fishery is comprised of other, larger species (e.g., <em>Alopias</em> and <em>Carcharhinus</em> spp.; Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009). However, the historical abundance of Leopard Sharks in this region is also unknown.",Marine,Least Concern,Triakidae
Centroscyllium nigrum,"The Combtooth Dogfish is a bycatch of deep-sea crustacean trawl fisheries for Red Squat Lobster (<em>Pleuroncodes monodon</em>), Yellow Squat Lobster (<em>Cervimunida johni</em>), and especially deep-sea shrimp (<em>Heterocarpus reedi</em>) off northern and central Chile which operate at depths of 259–498 m depth (González 2001, Acuña and Villarroel 2002, Acuña&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). In the deep-sea shrimp fishery, the Combtooth Dogfish&#160;is the third most abundant shark bycatch species, after the Hooktooth Dogfish (<em>Aculeola nigra</em>) and the Dusky Catshark (<em>Bythaelurus canescens</em>) (Acuña and Villarroel 2002). It is also a minor bycatch of longline fisheries for Southern Hake (<em>Merluccius australis</em>), Pink Cusk-eel (<em>Genypterus blacodes</em>), and Yellownose Skate (<em>Dipturus chilensis</em>) off southern Chile, which operate at depths of ~200–500 m (Vargas-Caro 2010, F.

Halaelurus boesemani,"<span lang=""EN-US"">While no specific information is available on catches of the Speckled Catshark, the high level of exploitation across its small range is of concern.

While the new Somali Fisheries Law now bans benthic trawling, decades of unregulated trawling may have already caused population-level impacts on this species, and implementation of regulations and enforcement remain a challenge (Glaser<em> et al.</em> 2015). Given the small size of the species, it is unlikely to be taken in longline fisheries, but may interact with small-meshed gillnet fisheries which are used by artisanal fisheries in the region and demersal trawls from illegal fishing by foreign vessels.",Marine,Vulnerable,Pentanchidae
Squatina africana,"The African Angelshark is caught in subsistence, artisanal, and industrial&#160;fisheries. <br/><br/>In South Africa, demersal trawling for prawns off the Thukela Banks, KZN overlapped with a potential nursery ground of this species (Fennessy 1994). For economic reasons this trawling has not been operational since 2010. However, similar trawling for the same target prawn species at the same depth range (&lt;50 m) occurs in Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania, and Madagascar, thus if these areas also serve as nurseries for African Angelshark, juveniles occurring there will be caught. Deep-water trawling effort off KZN has declined, with only two vessels regularly operating. The species has been recorded as being occasionally taken by recreational shore anglers (Bass <em>et al.</em> 1975, ORI unpubl. data 2018). In the KZN shark control program shark nets, the species is caught in low  numbers with a significant proportion released alive (although  post-release mortality is unknown).<br/><br/>There are no catch data for the species in either the shallow-water or deep-water prawn trawl fisheries in Mozambique; trawl fishing effort has declined slightly for the shallow-water sector but has increased considerably in the deep-water sector in recent years.<br/><br/>Catches recorded on the Saya-de-Malha Bank (northeast of Madagascar) were from research trawls; the (then) USSR did develop some commercial fisheries there but the rapid depletion of resources resulted in their closure, with no known commercial trawl ventures since the late 1970s (E. Romanov CAP RUN, La Réunion, pers. comm. July 2017).<br/><br/>The African Angelshark is taken in the shallow-water prawn trawl fishery in Tanzania and Kenya (Narriman Jiddawi, Institute of Marine Sciences, Zanzibar, pers. comm. 2003).

Although the Tanzanian deep-water crustacean fishery closed soon after 2006 (Kizska and Van der Elst 2015), a deep-water crustacean trawl fishery has recently commenced in Kenya. Kenyan shallow-water trawling effort has varied, with several closures.

Squatina legnota,"There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across Indonesia, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in many areas across the Indo-West Pacific (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006).&#160;Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high, but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996).&#160;Indonesia has a considerable fishing fleet (~600,000 fishing vessels in marine waters) (KKP 2016) and elasmobranchs are caught in a variety of fishing gears (e.g. demersal tangle net, trammel net, bottom trawl and longline, White<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2006). Despite a ban in 1980, benthic trawl fisheries still exist in Indonesia; small vessels (&lt;10&#160;Gross Tonnes) have modified their gear into ""mini trawls"" or&#160;<em>cakalang&#160;</em>which target and retain demersal species (H. Booth pers. comm. 30/11/2019). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009). For example, steep declines of wedgefishes (Rhinidae) have been documented&#160;as a result of target fisheries using large-mesh gillnets and tangle nets (D'Aberto&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). This fishery began in the 1970s and peaked at approximately 500 vessels in 1987 at Aru Island before declining to 100 vessels by 1996 (D'Aberto&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). <br/><br/>This species was reported to be caught incidentally on demersal longline fisheries operating on the continental shelf and upper slope (White<em> et al.</em> 2006).

Carcharhinus obsoletus,"<p>Shallow-water demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in Southeast Asia (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006), and this species is unlikely to have found any refuge as fishing effort in coastal waters and on the continental shelf has been extensive.&#160;Shark fishing (targeted or bycatch) is widespread, intensive, and generally unregulated across the region and practices are well known to be unsustainable (e.g. Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Dharmadi&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Arunrugstichai&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Sharks are captured in commercial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, traps, and seine nets. <br/><br/>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments, and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020).<br/><br/>In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 1970s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more tripled in Sarawak from 2, 251 vessels in 1950 to 7, 650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2002, A.

Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in demersal fisheries (e.g. Moura&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Discard mortality is unknown, but could be high; at vessel mortality for the congener, Owston's Dogfish (<em>Centroscymnus owstoni</em>), was found to be 80% (Ellis&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017).&#160; <br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004).&#160;A lack of species-specific information limits the ability to identify which species are reported from the region. Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from Black Hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em> and <em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2005). <br/><br/>In the Southwest Pacific, deep-water sharks are regularly reported as bycatch from offshore deep-water fisheries in New Zealand&#160;(Finucci&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Between 2008–2013, the Knifetooth Dogfish was not recorded in any commercial records (Francis 2015); the species may be recorded under a generic ""deep-water shark"" reporting code, however, reporting of deep-water shark catch to the species level has improved considerably with the introduction of identification guides (McMillan <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p>",Marine,Vulnerable,Somniosidae

Squatina armata,"The Chilean Angelshark is mainly taken as retained bycatch of trawl and gillnet fisheries throughout its range and angel sharks (Squatinidae) are known to be highly susceptible to capture by trawl and net fisheries (Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2020). In Colombia and Ecuador, this shark&#160;is taken as bycatch of the shrimp trawl fishery at depths to 80 m (Puentes <em>et al.</em> 2007). In Ecuador, it is taken in bycatch of the multi-purpose hake and shrimp fishery (García&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014) and is also captured with surface longline, trawl, bottom-set gillnet, and bottom longline (Martínez-Ortíz <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Peru, it is taken in target artisanal fisheries, mostly by gillnet but also some other gears. The bulk of the landings are from northern Peru, but landings are reported from the whole coast. Furthermore, it is taken as bycatch of the Peruvian hake fishery (Elliot <em>et al. </em>2003).<span lang=""EN-US""><br/><br/>Historically, in Ecuador, this species was subject to heavy fishing pressure, from southern Manabi to the Santa Elena Península, between 1995–2001&#160;due to the trade demand from Peru.

Currently,&#160;there is no directed fishery and there is no knowledge of the status of the resource&#160; (Martínez-Ortíz&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). Similarly, historically, this angel shark was targeted in Chile and there is anecdotal evidence from fishers indicating it has disappeared (Lamilla <em>et al.</em> 2005).&#160;After the target species, this is the&#160;second most important bycatch species captured in the flounder gillnet fishery in the Bay of Coquimbo (Hernandez <em>et al. </em>2010).

Squatina argentina,"The Argentine Angelshark is threatened by being caught as bycatch in demersal trawl and gillnet fisheries, and it was also previously targeted. <br/><br/>In southern Brazil, directed fisheries using bottom-gillnets on the outer shelf and upper slope developed rapidly between the 1990s and early 2000s and depleted this species (Vooren and Klippel 2005). At the beginning of the 2000s, another fishery developed in the area for the anglerfish&#160;<em>Lophius gastrophysis</em> with bottom gillnets at depths of 130 to 600 m, and this species was caught as bycatch (Perez and Wahrlich 2005, Mafra Pio <em>et al.</em> 2016). Since 2004, both of these fisheries have been closed, but angel sharks are still captured illegally by trawl and gillnet fisheries and landed without skins in clandestine ports (Montealegre-Quijano unpubl. data 2017).<br/><br/>The nocturnal habits of angel sharks render them susceptible to bottom gillnets which are set at night, and increases in captures during the 1990s are attributed to the introduction of this gear on the shelf and slope off southern Brazil at that time. Gillnets were reported as six times more effective at catching angel sharks than trawling alone (Vooren and Klippel 2005).<br/><br/>Part of this species' southern distribution in the Argentina-Uruguay Common Fishing Zone overlaps with the Patagonian scallop (<em>Zygochlamis patagonica</em>) bottom trawl fishery, which is likely to catch this species as bycatch.",Marine,Critically Endangered,Squatinidae

Squatina david,"Small-scale artisanal and commercial fisheries operate in the region, and sharks such as this species are likely taken as valuable bycatch. <br/><br/>In Colombia, this species is not known from shallow-water fisheries, and currently there are no deepwater fisheries in operation there.<br/><br/>In Venezuela, this species is caught in gillnets, trawls, and longlines (O. Lasso pers. comm. 01 June 2018). These fisheries have intensified over past decades and in the Gulf of Paria there were over 450 artisanal vessels which caught a peak of over 10,000 t of fish by the 1990s (Manickchand-Heileman <em>et al.</em> 2004). Industrial trawling for shrimp and demersal species was introduced in the 1940s and increased rapidly from the 1960s until the 1980s when there were 450 registered vessels (Mendoza 2015). Efforts to address over-exploitation and conflicts with artisanal fisheries led to a reduction to only 260 vessels in 2006, and an industrial trawl ban went into effect in 2009 (Mendoza 2015). Deepwater fisheries began in 2000 and have expanded geographically, and some stocks have collapsed (O.

Squatina squatina,"Angelsharks are highly susceptible to bycatch in demersal trawls, bottom-set longlines, gill nets, and dredges.

It may also be captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, as well as by rod and reel, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). The Salmon Shark was historically taken in the 1950s and 1960s in relatively large numbers (105,000–155,000 individuals per year) in open ocean gillnet fisheries that ceased operating in the early 1990s (Goldman and Musick 2008). <br/></p>  <p>Salmon Sharks are sometimes retained for their meat and fins (Cardeñosa <em>et al.</em> 2018, Fields&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018)<em>. </em>Under-reporting of catches in the pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The species is currently targeted by recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality.

Haploblepharus edwardsii,"The Happy Eddie is bycatch of a range of fisheries, including beach  seine, gillnet, trawl, recreational and commercial line,  rock lobster, and demersal shark longlines (da Silva <em>et al. </em>2015). This species has a greater likelihood of capture  in line fisheries compared to some other catsharks because it tends to take large hooks. Fisheries operate throughout its range, but trawl fishery effort in  South Africa has decreased substantially over the past two decades (S.  Fennessy, pers. comm., 20 April 2018). Recreational and rock lobster fishers consider the species a nuisance and persecute them as such, likely causing high mortality (Human 2009). When discarded from other fisheries, post-release mortality is likely low, based on generally very low at-vessel and post-release mortality for catsharks  (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017). The Happy Eddie has tended to move southward within South Africa over  three decades from 1981–2016, with a possible concurrent loss of area  occupied (Currie <em>et al</em>. 2019). The range shift is likely at least partially related to climate change (Rouault <em>et al.</em> 2010, Blamey <em>et al. </em>2015).

Hemitriakis leucoperiptera,"The Whitefin Topeshark is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range in the Philippines. It is taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale municipal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl, purse seine, longline, hook and line, gillnet, set net, and traps. Commercial fisheries are generally &gt;3 Gross Tonnage (GT) vessels and small-scale municipal fisheries are generally &lt;3GT vessels or not requiring vessels and are &lt;15 km from shore. All incidental catch in the Philippines appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014).<br/><br/>The fishing fleet rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s as small-scale artisanal fisheries became motorized and evolved into commercial fisheries. By the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines, but government and foreign aid continued to subsidize motorizing of artisanal vessels into the late 1990s (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014). ‘Baby trawlers’ operate intensively in inshore waters and in waters less than 13 m deep, waters traditionally reserved for small-scale artisanal fishers (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Small-scale fishers mostly use cast nets, gillnets, hook and line, spear, traps and pots, and barriers (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, demersal trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Inshore demersal stocks are considered over-exploited with growth overfishing apparent (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020).

In some areas, including near MPAs, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010).

Hypogaleus hyugaensis,"There are no known targeted fisheries for the Pencil Shark, but it is caught as bycatch in a number of fisheries throughout its range, including Australia, South Africa and Japan. It is taken in demersal gillnets set by commercial shark fishers in Western Australia (Simpfendorfer and Donohue 1998). Catch and effort data are available in this fishery from 1989–1999 and show that although catches have decreased over this period the catch rates have remained stable, suggesting there has been little impact on the population (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2002). Little is known of this species in Taiwan and Japan, but both countries have large inshore demersal fisheries that may catch this species. It is also caught in trawl fisheries off the east coast of southern and eastern Africa, including the shrimp trawl fishery off KwaZulu-Natal (Bass <em>et al</em>. 1975). Little data are available for this fishery, but intensive fishing may have caused some previous decline in the stock. However, these trawl fisheries have decreased in effort since 2008 and catches are now likely minor as it was not reported in South African fisheries catches from 2010–2012 (da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015, S.

Mustelus asterias,"<p>The Starry Smoothhound occurs in coastal waters where fishing pressure is substantial through a&#160;large&#160;portion of its range. In the Northeast Atlantic, this species is&#160;caught seasonally as bycatch in trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries, some of which discard or land the species, depending on market demands (ICES 2012). ICES landing statistics combine dogfish and smoothhounds together, so  there are little accurate data on Northeast Atlantic landings, and  levels of bycatch are largely unknown. There are areas of local abundance of the Starry Smoothhound throughout its range. Preliminary analyses of bycatch data indicate that juveniles are typically discarded, but no evaluation of discard survival rate has been undertaken (ICES 2012). Fishing mortality was estimated from the catch ratio from surveys of the Northeast Atlantic across the sub-adult and adult age classes (5–13 years). Since 1992, the fishing mortality has been variable, but overall has declined from 0.25 to 0.15.

Semi-industrial fisheries in the Adriatic Sea, off Sicily, Spain and Cyprus are known to take&#160;<em>Mustelus</em>&#160;spp., and also artisanal fisheries elsewhere (Colloca&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Following two centuries of fisheries development, shark and ray fisheries developed in the 1950s, with catches peaking until the 1970s, after which a decreasing trend was reported along with a decline in diversity of species (Cavanagh and Gibson 2007, Davidson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). A number of shark and ray species are now considered to be locally extinct due to overexploitation (e.g., Ferretti<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2008).&#160;<p>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Furthermore, this has led to population reductions of many species of sharks and rays including the local extinction of sawfishes (family Pristidae) from West African coastal waters and several species of wedgefishes from their northern range in Mauritania and Senegal (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;Fernandez-Carvalho&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014,&#160;Kyne&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020).

In West Africa, reports indicate that the diversity and average body size of many important commercial coastal, demersal, and pelagic fishery species have markedly declined with many stocks now considered to be overexploited (Ajayi 1994, Srinivasan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012,&#160;CCLME 2016,&#160;Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Trawl surveys carried out across the Gulf of Guinea from 1977­–2000 showed a decline in fish biomass of demersal resources and&#160;deep sea pelagic catches of approximately 50% (Brashares&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). Further, in Mauritania, the total demersal biomass of inshore stocks is estimated to have declined by 75% since 1982 (Meissa and Gascuel 2015). The direct cause of decline for many of these stocks has been attributed to overcapacity within both the industrial and artisanal fisheries in addition to destructive fishing practices (GCLME 2006, CCLME 2016). Overall, between&#160;1950–2010, the total artisanal fishing effort increased by 10-fold with an estimated 252,000 unregulated artisanal and 3,300 industrial vessels&#160;operating in this region by 2010&#160;(mostly distant water fleets from Europe and East Asia operating under ‘access agreements’ that take sharks and rays as bycatch) (Walker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Diop and Dossa 2011, Belhabib&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).</p><p><span style="""">In the southeast Atlantic, the Common Smoothhood is also targeted or captured as bycatch. Since 2002, artisanal and recreational fishing pressure in a few parts of southern Angola has increased while other areas remain&#160;unfished (Beckensteiner <em>et al.</em> 2016). The species is also taken by recreational anglers off Namibia (NATMIRC 2003). However, parts of Namibia are remote and may offer refuge from fishing pressure (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2015). In South Africa, declines in linefish species has led to increased exploitation of demersal sharks, such as&#160;the Common Smoothhound&#160;as both target and bycatch. Fisheries catch data for&#160;this species&#160;in this area is problematic due to misidentification and high levels of under-reporting.&#160;However, this species is one of the top five most valuable commercial species in the demersal shark longline fishery, commercial&#160;</span>line fishery, and inshore trawl fishery (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>Destructive fishing practices including intensive inshore and offshore trawling with increasing incursions into coastal areas, the use of explosives and chemicals in inshore areas, and the use of small-sized beach and purse seine nets in both nearshore and offshore regions, have contributed to depleted fish stocks across the Eastern Central Atlantic region, which covers part of the species' range (Koranteng 1998, GCLME 2006, Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Specifically, China’s West African fleet has rapidly increased in recent years with an estimated 518 vessels (82% of them trawlers) currently operating in the Eastern Central Atlantic (mostly between Morocco and Gabon) (Gutierrez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). This region also has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world and it is estimated that illegal catches exceed more than 40% of the reported legal catch (Pauly and Zeller 2016).</p>The shallow, inshore soft-substrate habitats used by this species are threatened by habitat loss and environmental degradation (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, White and Sommerville 2010, Jabado<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation, conversion of coastal lagoons and mangrove deforestation for agriculture (e.g., rice and salt) and aquaculture (e.g., shrimp, fish culture, and fish production); extensive oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production; the effects of rapid urban expansion from growing coastal populations and unplanned tourism development; pollution (unregulated sewage effluents, agricultural runoff, hydrocarbon, and heavy metals); sedimentation and siltation; and changes to the hydrological cycle from the building of dams leading to dramatic levels of habitat loss evident across the region (GCLME 2006, FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).",Marine,Endangered,Triakidae
Triakis acutipinna,"Small-scale fisheries that catch shark operate across coastal Ecuador. The Sharpfin Houndshark is reportedly caught very rarely in coastal artisanal demersal gillnet fisheries (Martínez-Ortiz and García-Domínguez 2013, Cevallos-Garcias&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;submitted). A recently interviewed fisher indicated that the species has been  taken as bycatch in the industrial  hake fishery which uses demersal longlines at around  200 m depth (Cevallos-Garcias&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;submitted).",Marine,Endangered,Triakidae
Triakis megalopterus,"The Spotted Gully Shark is targeted in recreational line fisheries and occasionally taken as bycatch in beach seine, commercial line, longline, and trawl fisheries (Compagno 2009, Booth <em>et al. </em>2011, Best <em>et al.</em> 2013, Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2015, da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). Recreational fishers typically release this species in South Africa, and some houndsharks have been shown to have low post-release mortality (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2017). Effort in South African shore line fisheries has decreased as a result of a 2002 South African ban on all-terrain vehicles on beaches. Parts of Namibia are remote and offer refuge from fishing pressure (Belhabib <em>et al.</em> 2015). Since 2002, artisanal and recreational fishing pressure in a few parts of southern Angola has increased while other areas remain unfished (Beckensteiner <em>et al.</em> 2016).",Marine,Least Concern,Triakidae
Carcharhinus borneensis,"Shallow-water demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in Southeast Asia (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006), and this species is unlikely to have found any refuge as fishing effort in coastal waters and on the continental shelf has been extensive. Shark fishing (targeted or bycatch) is widespread, intensive, and generally unregulated across the region and practices are well known to be unsustainable (e.g. Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Dharmadi <em>et al</em>. 2015, Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018). Sharks are captured in commercial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, traps, and seine nets. <br/><br/>Sharks are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). The number of fishers increased by 165% from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Indonesia has been the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years, with average landings reported to be over 100,000 t (Jaiteh <em>et al</em>. 2017) and worth an estimated $125 million USD in export (Booth et al. 2018). Carcharhinids are commonly caught by demersal trawl and inshore demersal gillnet fisheries and commonly landed in local fish markets (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Carcharhinids are landed in 90% of fisheries operating in Indonesia (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018) and in some areas, over 50% of sharks landed are juveniles (Nawawi <em>et al</em>. 2020). <br/><br/>Fisheries are an important sector in Malaysia, significantly contributing to the national economy, employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 1970s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). The number of vessels across all sectors has more tripled in Sarawak from 2, 251 vessels in 1950 to 7, 650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). There has been, and currently still is, a rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (Fowler et al. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption and are concentrated in the inshore waters and reefs, which has contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2009). The number of vessels across all sectors in Sarawak had more than doubled from 2,251 vessels in 1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). Reporting to FAO for sharks and rays comprises ~3% of global catch at 23,808 t per year through 2000–2010. Purse seine and gillnets contribute to the majority of the landings. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed from large vessels &gt;70 GT.<br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010). In the South China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years, modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds, and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman 2009).",Marine,Critically Endangered,Carcharhinidae
Rhizoprionodon terraenovae,"Atlantic Sharpnose Sharks are captured in longlines, gillnets, trawls, and recreationally on hook and line. In the United States in 2016, estimated commercial landings were 302,516 lbs dressed weight while recreational catches were 76,396 individuals (NMFS 2017). The numbers caught as bycatch in commercial shrimp trawl were estimated at 1,025 individuals. In Mexico, it is fished in the Gulf of Mexico (from Tamaulipas to Yucatan) and the Caribbean (Quintana Roo), where it represents up to 45.9% of the annual catches from artisanal fisheries, which target 40 elasmobranch species (Castillo-Géniz <em>et al. </em>1998).",Marine,Least Concern,Carcharhinidae
Centrophorus uyato,"<p>The Little Gulper Shark is taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in mid-water and demersal trawl, surface and demersal longline, and setnet fisheries. <br/><br/>Where targeted fishing occurs, fishing activity has been intensive. In the Philippines, deep-water dogfish fisheries (<em>Centrophorus </em>spp and <em>Squalus </em>spp), dating back to the 1960s, are known for their boom-and-bust nature and collapse over short periods of time (~10 years) before effort is shifted into new regions (Flores 2004). <br/><br/>In India, fisheries employing a number of gear types (trawl, longline, gill net, hook and line) have expanded further offshore into deeper waters as inshore stocks become heavily exploited. A targeted gulper shark liver oil fishery (operating at depths of &gt;300–1,000 m) commenced in 2002, and between 2002–2008, there was a major increase in landings of deep-water sharks (see Akhilesh<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2011, 2013, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013). Targeting fishing has also occurred off the Andaman Islands and Sri Lanka since the 1980s (Soundararajan and Roy 2004, A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/2019).&#160;Reports of large quantities of shark liver oil recently transported out of Somalia may be indicative of developing fisheries in this region (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, this species was previously reported in small quantities in Portuguese longline fisheries (ICES-WGEF 2018). It is reported in bottom longlines and trammel nets throughout the Mediterranean (Guallart 1998,&#160;<a class=""linked-name"" style=""font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; overflow-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-word;"">Massutí and Moranta 2003,&#160;</a>Lteif<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, deep-water sharks are still captured in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;Discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sánchez 2017) and the extent of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is unknown (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;of deep-water sharks and dogfishes&#160;across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis&#160;</em>and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Kainge<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Gulper sharks are occasionally reported (&lt;1 t annually between 2010–12) in demersal trawl and hake longline fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>The species likely has some refuge from fishing in the US Gulf of Mexico, where Royal Red Shrimp (<em>Pleoticus robustus</em>)&#160;trawl fisheries operate on relatively restricted fishing grounds adjacent to home ports at depths of 250–550 m (Stiles&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Reed and Farrington 2010). The species, however, is still susceptible to longline fisheries (Driggers <em>et al. </em>2017). Elsewhere in the Gulf, there are a number of deep-water fisheries where&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp have been reported (Benavides&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). There are a number of deep-water fisheries from Venezuela, fishing at depths of 200–800 m; demersal chondrichthyans are not targeted but are encountered as bycatch (O. Lasso-Alcalá unpubl. data 2019). There is increasing interest in developing deep-water fisheries in the Caribbean (e.g.&#160;Paramo&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017) and the development of any fishery should be monitored as this species may be susceptible to being caught as bycatch.<br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).</p>",Marine,Endangered,Centrophoridae
Chlamydoselachus anguineus,"The Frilled Shark is infrequently taken as bycatch in demersal and midwater trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries across most of its range (e.g., Neat <em>et al. </em>2015, Delgado <em>et al. </em>2017, Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2021). There are a few known regions where the species has been more frequently recorded, including off Japan and New Zealand (Kubota <em>et al.</em> 1991, B. Finucci, unpub. data).&#160;A single trawl off the mid-Atlantic Ridge to the north of the Azores recorded 34 Frilled Sharks in 2003 and it was suspected that this trawl took place during a mating event (Kukueva and Pavlov 2008). Any expansion of fisheries into deeper waters or previously unexploited areas where the Frilled Shark is known to occur should be closely monitored.",Marine,Least Concern,Chlamydoselachidae
Cirrhigaleus barbifer,"There is no specific information available on bycatch of this species. It is possibly a bycatch of deep-water dropline fisheries that operate off the northeast coast of Taiwan at depths of 100–300 m; these fisheries began in the 1980s and target mostly tuna with all the incidental catch retained (H. Ho and H. Hsu unpubl. data 2019). One specimen was recently captured by demersal trawl in northeast Taiwan and photographed; trawls operate at depths of 300–700 m (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). One specimen was recently captured by commercial demersal gillnet at a depth of 300 m in Tokyo Submarine Canyon; there is only one fisher that has operated in that area since the 1980s (Miyazaki <em>et al. </em>2019). It may be encountered by Japanese commercial demersal dropline fisheries that operate at depths of 400–800 m around the islands and seamounts of Sagami Bay and target Splendid Alfonsino (<em>Beryx spledens</em>), however interactions with the Mandarin Shark have not been reported. In Indonesia, it is a rare bycatch of demersal deep-water longline fisheries and is retained when captured (White <em>et al. </em>2006). Longline fisheries operate to a depth of 100 m in Western Sumatra and at depths of 150–400 m in Lombok, Indonesia and the species would have refuge at depth in Indonesia (Fahmi and Sentosa 2017, Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,Least Concern,Squalidae
Hemigaleus microstoma,"Throughout its distribution, the Sicklefin Weasel Shark is caught in coastal fisheries by demersal trawl, tangle nets, set nets, gill nets, droplines, longlines, and Danish seine (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009). It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries. In India, there is high level of fisheries exploitation with most stocks fully exploited (FAO 2020b). Juveniles are found in estuaries and high fishing effort, particularly with stake and doll nets, occurs in this habitat. The majority of the geographic distribution of this species in the region overlaps with intense coastal fisheries. Approximately 24,554 trawl vessels are operating in the Indian part of the range (CMFRI 2010). There has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power over the past 30 years. About 6,600 trawlers are operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, over 13,400 gill netters are operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010).<br/><br/>In Sri Lanka, fishing takes place all around the coast, but primarily within the continental shelf. The potential yield from coastal fish resources has been estimated at 250,000 t per year with 170,000 t per year from coastal pelagic species and 80,000 t from demersal species (Blindheim and Foyn 1980). Coastal fisheries still account for about 67% of the marine fishes caught, but there are some uncertainties regarding further expansion of coastal fishing activities (Wijayaratne 2001). Survey catch rate of sharks and rays was 105 kg per hour in 1980 from the Fritjof Nansen survey (Table VI, Sivasubramaniam and Maldeniya 1985). Approximately 28,000 fishing crafts are operating in Sri Lanka. Out of this, 87% of crafts operate in the coastal fishery which consists of traditional non-motorised crafts and fiberglass-reinforced plastic boats with inboard engines. Both types of vessels are generally day boats, not venturing far from the coast (Wijayaratne 2001). Over 28,000 fishing crafts are now operating, including multi-day boats that remain at sea sometimes for 20–25 days (NARA 2003).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters before a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004, large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004, sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al</em>. 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners. International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased by nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013 but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.<br/><br/>In Thailand, this species is caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The gulf coast is considered one of the most overfished regions of the world due to the rapid industrialization of its fishing fleet (Sylwester 2014). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).<br/><br/>Fisheries are an important sector in Malaysia, significantly contributing to the national economy, employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). All bycatch in Malaysia is retained for the meat for human consumption, for bait in traps or for fish meal production for aquaculture. Unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160; There has been and is still currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption and are concentrated to the inshore waters and reefs, which has contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, this species is commercially valuable, with most specimens caught as bycatch landed and sold for meat. The meat is consumed locally either fresh or dried and salted (FAO 2011). Intensive trawl and gillnetting occurs throughout the Malacca Strait and Danish seines operate throughout Kalimantan and the Java Sea (Fahmi unpub. data 2020). Thus, the level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). The number of fishers increased by 165% from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Indonesia has been the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years, with average landings reported to be over 100,000 t (Jaiteh <em>et al</em>. 2017) and worth an estimated $125 million USD in export (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018). Carcharhinids are commonly caught by bottom trawl and inshore demersal gillnet fisheries and commonly landed in local fish markets (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Carcharhinids are landed in 90% of fisheries operating in Indonesia (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018) and in some areas, over 50% of sharks landed are juveniles (Nawawi <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, the Sicklefin Weasel Shark is taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale municipal fisheries. Commercial fisheries are generally &gt;3 Gross Tonnage (GT) vessels and small-scale municipal fisheries are generally &lt;3GT vessels or not requiring vessels and are &lt;15 km from shore. All incidental catch in the Philippines appears to be retained as discards are virtually non-existent (Palomares and Pauly 2014). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b). The fishing fleet in the Philippines rapidly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s as small-scale artisanal fisheries became motorized and evolved into commercial fisheries. By the 1980s, overfishing was apparent throughout the Philippines, but government and foreign aid continued to subsidize motorizing of artisanal vessels into the late 1990s (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine EEZ tripled from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels). Fishing shifted from mainly inshore demersal to offshore pelagic species during the late 1980s (Palomares and Pauly 2014). ‘Baby trawlers’ operate intensively in inshore waters and waters less than 13 m deep, waters traditionally reserved for small-scale artisanal fishers (Palomares <em>et al</em>. 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>The Sicklefin Weasel Shark is subject to intense fishing pressure within Viet Nam. It is taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries and it is retained for human consumption or fish meal production (FAO 2020a). There is a high level of fisheries resource use throughout Viet Nam. Most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020a). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh et al. 2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020a). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020a, Helgil 2020a). Viet Nam is among the top 20 importers of shark meat for 2008–2017 (Oakes and Sant 2019).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, shark fishing has a long history with sharks historically targeted by trawl and longline fisheries from the late 1920s when 6,000 t was landed annually (Chen 1997). Most fisheries subsequently moved to taking shark as bycatch, except for some vessels that continued to target shark in the east and northeast of Taiwan up until at least the late 1990s; the gears included demersal longlines set at depths of 80–200 m, mid-water longline, and large-mesh drift nets (till 1992 when they were prohibited in Taiwan) (Chen 1997). Taiwan ranks among the top 20 shark fishing nations globally and is a major global shark fin and shark meat trading nation (Oakes and Sant 2019). By the 1950s, the Taiwan coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. In Taiwan, the number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28 August 2019). Demersla trawling operates to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. The demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).<br/><br/>In China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990–2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Wagey <em>et al</em>. 2017). In some areas, including near MPAs, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Marine,Vulnerable,Hemigaleidae
Chiloscyllium punctatum,"The Grey Carpetshark is a common target and incidental catch of trawl, gillnet, longline, and handline industrial and artisanal fisheries across Southeast Asia and is retained mainly for its meat (Dharmadi <em>et al</em>. 2015). It is released in some areas, such as occasionally in Malaysian artisanal fisheries where although generally all catch is retained, sometimes bamboo sharks (<em>Chiloscyllium</em> spp.) are selectively released (Lim<em> et al</em>. 2021). This is a robust species able to survive out of water for a few hours and thus, post-release survival is likely to be high.<br/><br/>Across Southeast Asia, there is substantial and generally unregulated and unmanaged fishing pressure. India has an intensive fishing fleet of trawlers and gillnetters and this species is occasionally landed as incidental catch of the commercial shrimp trawl fisheries along the Tamil Nadu and Andrha Pradesh coast and is consumed fresh locally (K.K. Bineesh unpub. data). In Thailand, most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited, particularly in the Gulf of Thailand (Derrick <em>et al</em>. 2017). In Indonesia, fishing effort in archipelagic waters is intense and across all sectors has been increasing since 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s (Tull 2014). Indonesia has the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally, and reports substantial catches of target and non-target chondrichthyans (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). It has been among the top shark fishing nations for over 20 years (Oakes and Sant 2019). Within the Indonesia-Malaysia archipelago (relevant for the operational taxonomic unit), the threats to this species are high due to the intensive trawl fisheries (Fahmi <em>et al</em>. 2021a). However, on the west coast of Sumatra and in the Lesser Sunda Island region, the habitat precludes demersal trawling thus reducing fishing pressure; it would still be caught in demersal longline fisheries but these are not as intensive as trawl fisheries in the wider Indonesia-Malaysia region (Fahmi <em>et al</em>. 2021a). Coastal fisheries in Cambodia are considered overexploited and in Viet Nam, most marine stocks have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Teh<em> et al</em>. 2014b). In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and net fisheries during the preceding 30 years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>In Papua New Guinea, the fishing pressure is relatively minor and this species is commonly caught in the Gulf of Papua Prawn Trawl Fishery where it accounts for 3.7% of the shark and ray catch; it is assessed with medium risk from the fishery, mainly based on a relatively high susceptibility to capture in the fishery (Baje <em>et al</em>. 2021). It is also taken in small-scale coastal fisheries in some areas (White <em>et al</em>. 2017). In Australia, the threats are minimal and managed; the Grey Carpetshark is caught incidentally in trawl and net fisheries and released as shark and ray retention is prohibited in trawl fisheries and it is of low commercial value. The species is caught in the Commonwealth Northern Prawn Fishery where it accounted for 1.6% of the shark and ray catch and it is considered at low risk of overfishing due to estimated fishing mortality being below levels leading to population reduction (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2000, Zhou and Griffiths 2008). The mandated use of bycatch reduction devices including Turtle Excluder Devices significantly reduced the catch of this species (Brewer <em>et al</em>. 2004). It also has significant refuge in the marine park network and in considerable areas of its range that are either unfished or lightly fished (Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2021).<br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation, and pollution (e.g., heavy metals) (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009, MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands. There has been a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, as well as modifications to about 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al</em>. 1995, FAO 2020).",Marine,Near Threatened,Hemiscylliidae
Hemipristis elongata,"The Snaggletooth Shark is targeted and taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries in a variety of gear including gillnet, longline and demersal trawl, and is retained in some countries for the meat and fins. The majority of the geographic distribution of this species overlaps with intense coastal fisheries that with increasing populations have increased in effort over the past three decades. The species is heavily fished across its east African range and has not been reported recently in South African fisheries except for rare catches in the Kwa-Zulu Natal beach protection nets (&lt;1 individual annually) (Cliff and Olbers 2022). It is caught in several east African artisanal fisheries; for e.g., it accounted for 3% of the elasmobranchs at Kilwa (Tanzania) landing sites and fish markets from 2020–2022 (Rumisha <em>et al</em>. 2023). In the Arabian Seas and adjacent waters, it is taken in very small quantities in fisheries throughout the Persian Gulf and Red Sea (Moore and Peirce 2013, Spaet and Berumen 2015, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015) and the high level of fisheries effort in the species' depth range is of concern. For example, uncontrolled expansion of industrial trawling in the Red Sea has depleted marine resources (PERSGA 2002); in Somalia, illegal and unregulated fishing by foreign trawlers and longliners is rife and impacting shark populations (Glaser <em>et al</em>. 2015); and in India, there were over 6,548 gill netters and 30,772 trawlers operating, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI-FSI-DoF 2020).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters before a nationwide ban on targeting sharks in 2004, large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since then, sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in intensive coastal artisanal fisheries (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al</em>. 2020). The gillnet and trawl fisheries in Indonesia are very extensive and as a result, many shark species are highly exploited. For example, stocks of most species had declined by the late 1990s in the Java Sea by at least an order of magnitude from 1976–1997 (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009) and the Snaggletooth Shark has not been seen in the Java Sea in recent years (N. Simeon unpub. data). In the Gulf of Thailand, this species was once considered common, however, by the early 2000s, it was rare (L.J.V Compagno, pers. comm. 2003). Similarly, in the waters of the South China Sea (including Hong Kong and parts of mainland China) this species was recorded in historic surveys, but has been absent since the early 2000s (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011) indicating that it may have become locally extinct in some parts of Asia.<br/><br/>The Snaggletooth Shark is a minor component of the Australian gillnet and trawl fisheries. For example, in the inshore gillnet fishery on the east coast (Queensland) it accounts for 0.3% of the catch and in the southwest coast (Western Australia) shark gillnet fishery, only two individuals were observed from 1993–2020 (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011, Braccini and Murua 2022). In Western Australia, fishing intensity is currently negligible with no directed shark fishing occurring north of 26°S since 2012, prohibition on landing sharks in most commercial fisheries, and low recreational catch of sharks (Braccini <em>et al</em>. 2020, Braccini <em>et al</em>. 2021, Braccini and Murua 2022). The species' catch in the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery is small, it is prohibited from retention, and estimates of fishing mortality indicated that the catch is sufficiently low to ensure sustainability (Zhou and Griffiths 2008).",Marine,Endangered,Hemigaleidae
Odontaspis ferox,"The Smalltooth Sandtiger is rarely captured and is taken as targeted catch and bycatch in artisanal, recreational, and industrial fisheries across its range using a wide range of fishing gears, including midwater and demersal trawl, vertical and demersal longline, demersal gillnet, spears, harpoons, and hand line (Fergusson <em>et al</em>. 2008, Barcelos <em>et al</em>. 2018, Higgs<em> et al</em>. 2022). The species has historically been confused and recorded as other species, including the Sand Tiger Shark (<em>Carcharias taurus</em>), the Prickly Shark (<em>Echinorhinus cookei</em>), and smoothhound (<em>Mustelus</em> spp.), making it difficult to directly assess the effect of fishing over time. However, given that these other species have been severely depleted and undergone local extinctions historically (e.g., Rigby <em>et al</em>. 2021), then it is likely that this species will have suffered a similar fate. It is likely that incidental catches of Smalltooth Sandtiger are greater than reported, particularly as juveniles are more easily landed and sold without attracting attention or proper identification (Fergusson <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Reported catches in shallow waters (&lt;200 m) (e.g., Fergusson <em>et al</em>. 2008, Barcelos <em>et al</em>. 2018, Mucientes <em>et al</em>. 2023), suggest the species is susceptible to capture in many intense and unregulated coastal fisheries across its range and hence, its absence from shelf fisheries in the North Atlantic can be inferred to have resulted from early overfishing. Like the Sand Tiger Shark, the Smalltooth Sandtiger's tendency to aggregate increases its risk to targeted fishing and capture (e.g., Chiaramonte <em>et al</em>. 2007). Since the 1970s, there has been a substantial increase in deepwater fishing effort worldwide and the depths at which the Smalltooth Sandtiger commonly lives (300–700 m) are regularly fished. Recent deepwater catches (to 731 m) from the Western Central Atlantic are indicative of regional fisheries expansion into deeper waters and this expansion may be increasing the species' risk where it previously had refuge from fishing activities (Higgs <em>et al</em>. 2022). Deepwater sharks are becoming more frequently recorded at local landing sites in countries including Belize and Guatemala and should be closely monitored (Hacohen-Domené <em>et al</em>. 2020, Baremore <em>et al</em>. 2021). The likely very low fecundity of the species would significantly reduce its resilience to fishing pressure.",Marine,Endangered,Odontaspididae
Apristurus melanoasper,"Deepwater catsharks of the genus <em>Apristurus</em> are very morphologically conservative, making species-specific identification difficult (e.g., White <em>et al</em>. 2023). Deepwater catshark records, e.g., <em>Apristurus</em> spp. that possibly include the Black Roughscale Catshark, are often been reported in fishing records under a generic category, if recorded at all (e.g., Neat<em> et al</em>. 2015, Anderson and Finucci 2022). The genus is generally recorded from depths &gt;1,000 m (Neat <em>et al</em>. 2015), beyond the operational depth of most fisheries, offering refuge from fishing activities across much of its range.<br/><br/>In the Southwest Indian Ocean, a mixture of demersal and mid-water trawl, and longline fisheries operate to depths of 1,500 m in the high seas, targeting commercial species such as Alfonsino (<em>Beryx</em> spp.), Orange Roughy (<em>Hoplostethus atlanticus</em>), and historically, deepwater sharks (FAO 2020). The status of bycatch species in these fisheries is unknown; the Black Roughscale Catshark was assessed to have medium-high vulnerability to capture in demersal trawls in this region (Georgeson <em>et al</em>. 2020) although no records exist to verify that this species is taken in significant amounts as bycatch in these fisheries. In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, deepwater fishing effort has decreased thus decreasing potential bycatch there (ICES 2022). There are no deepwater fisheries within the species' range in the western Atlantic Ocean.",Marine,Least Concern,Pentanchidae
Apristurus fedorovi,"There is no specific information available on bycatch of this species.&#160;However, it is possibly taken as bycatch and discarded in the shallower part of its depth range on the outer continental shelf (A. Yamagachi and S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). A commercial deep-water demersal trawl fishery operates to a maximum depth of 1,500 m off Iwate, eastern Japan up to southeast of Hokkaido (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The Stout Catshark is a possible bycatch within that portion of its geographic range (approximately 40% of its range), however it has not been reported. This fishery targets Atka Mackerel (<em>Pleurogrammus monopterygius</em>), and&#160;typically operates to 1,000 m depth (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). An Alaska Pollock (<em>Theragra chalcogramma</em>) fishery operates off the northeast coast of Hokkaido to depths of 500 m within the northernmost part of this species' range (Y.

The Emperor Seamount fisheries have  operated since 1967 and fished heavily during the 1960s to 1980s mostly  at depths of 300–600 m (Baco <em>et al.</em> 2019). The fisheries  currently operate mostly in the Southern Emperor seamounts at depths of 300–500 m.

The demersal trawl fisheries mainly  target North Pacific Armourhead (<em>Pentaceros wheeleri</em>) that occur at depths of 146–800 m and Splendid Alfosino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) that occurs at depths of 25–1,300 m (Froese and Pauly 2019, NPFC 2020).",Marine,Least Concern,Pentanchidae
Apristurus longicephalus,"There is no specific information available on bycatch of the Longhead Catshark. It is possibly a bycatch of Japanese deepwater commercial trawl fisheries which operate to depths of ~700 m (Rigby <em>et al</em>. 2020). It is possibly also a bycatch of deepwater trawl fisheries which operate off the northeast and southwest coasts of Taiwan at depths of 300–700 m; these fisheries target multiple species of prawns with all incidental catch retained (Rigby <em>et al</em>. 2020). In the Philippines, the species' upper-depth limit is beyond the reach of the trawl fisheries that operate to a maximum depth of 200 m (Rigby <em>et al</em>. 2020). It may have previously been encountered in the Philippines by bottom-set multiple hook-and-line gear that targeted dogfish sharks for their liver oil; the fishery was intensive from the 1960s–1980s and still operates but at an artisanal scale (Gaudiano and Alava 2003, Flores 2004, Rigby <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Indonesia, deepwater demersal longline fisheries mostly operate at depths of 100–200 m and thus the species would not be caught. In New Caledonia, there are currently no deepwater fisheries. In Australian waters, it may be encountered in a few fisheries at the upper limit of its depth range but the fisheries effort is minimal (Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2022). In Mozambique, a crustacean trawl fishery operates at depths of 100–600 m and may encounter this species at the upper limit of its depth range. Effort, however, has been declining substantially since 2007; the 2016 effort level was half the 2012 level, which in-turn was only 30% of that in the early 1990s. Currently there are 2–3 vessels operating at any one time, for a total of around 1,000 trawls per year (Pollom <em>et al</em>. 2020). Other trawl fisheries in southern Mozambique (Jacquet <em>et al</em>. 2010, Benkenstein 2013) may threaten this species.

In Myanmar, it is reported from research surveys at depths of 503–1,040 m (Psomadakis <em>et al.</em> 2019). Commercial trawl fisheries only operate to 100 m and conger eel line fisheries operate at depths of 70–200 m (A. Maung unpubl. data 2020), neither of which fish deep enough to encounter this species. In the Philippines, the species' upper-depth limit is beyond the reach of the trawl fisheries that operate to a maximum depth of 200 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020).

The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H.

Prior to 30 years ago (about one generation length) this species would not have been fished in Taiwan as it was beyond the depth of the fishing gear. During the monsoon season, conditions preclude deep-water  trawling and some trawlers operate in the shallower depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho pers. comm. 28 August 2019); this would provide a reprieve from fishing pressure for the Blackfin Gulper Shark. Deep-water longlines in Taiwan operate at depths of  100–300 m (H. Ho and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28 August 2019) and thus are unlikely to capture this species as its upper depth limit is beyond the reach of the longline gear. <br/><br/>In China, this species has only been reported to date from a research survey. Most commercial fisheries in China operate to a maximum depth of 300 m (X. Chen pers. comm. 28 August 2019) and thus are unlikely to capture this species.<br/><br/>In Indonesia, this species is taken on deep-water demersal longlines that operate at depths of 150–600 m (White<em> et al.</em> 2006). Fishing pressure in Indonesia is intense with the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally, and substantial catches of target and bycatch chondrichthyans (White<em> et al.</em> 2006). In the Philippines, deep-water dogfish are targeted for their liver oil using bottom set multiple hook-and-line gear and likely include captures of the Blackfin Gulper Shark (Flores 2004, Gaudiano and Alava 2003).",Marine,Endangered,Centrophoridae
Etmopterus sheikoi,"<p>The Rasptooth Dogfish is a bycatch of demersal deep-water trawls and is retained for fish meal. It is possibly taken by longline, although it has not been reported from longlines in Taiwan (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). The small size of the species may reduce its catchability. Deep-water trawl fisheries operate on the east coast of Taiwan, targeting multiple species of shrimp with all the incidental catch retained and marketed (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). The fishery on the east coast, particularly operations out of Da-xi, has moved into deeper waters over the past 30 years (from 1998–2019) due to depletion of shallow water shrimp species. The fishery has moved from fishing depths of 100–300 m to depths of 300–700 m (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). Although there is no detailed effort data, the number of trawl vessels operating in the northeast of Taiwan has remained fairly stable from 1999–2008 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). During the monsoon season, conditions preclude deep-water trawling and some trawlers operate in the shallower depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho pers. comm. 28 August 2019).&#160;</p><p>In Japan, bottom trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S.

Pseudotriakis microdon,"Localized populations of this large shark could be rapidly depleted if it began to be captured more regularly, however, at present it is of little interest to fisheries and is only taken as sporadic bycatch. <br/><br/>Most specimens of this species have been taken on deep-set longlines or in deepwater demersal trawls. Among the specimens reported in the literature as taken from commercial fishing operations, individuals have been captured as bycatch of trawls for Atlantic Halibut (<em>Hippoglossus hippoglossus</em>) in the North Atlantic Ocean (Gilhen and Coad 1999) and Orange Roughy (<em>Hoplostethus atlanticus</em>) in the southern Indian Ocean (Allen and Cowan 1995), deep longlines targeting black scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus</em> spp.) off the Canary Islands in the Eastern Central Atlantic (Pajuelo <em>et al</em>. 2010), developmental fishing surveys for demersal longline fisheries in the North Pacific Ocean (Yano 1992), targeted shark longline fishing in eastern Indonesia (Yulianto <em>et al</em>. 2018), and exploratory deepwater dropline fishing targeting deepwater reef fishes, particularly Flame and Ruby Snapper (<em>Etelis</em> spp.) and Bar Cod (<em>Epinephelus</em> spp.) off Queensland, Australia (Kyne <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Marine,Least Concern,Pseudotriakidae

While taken in smaller numbers than other sharks, of concern is that this species occupies only a narrow band of upper slope habitat which is fished by these fisheries and it has no refuge in deeper waters outside the fishing grounds.

Mustelus dorsalis,"Identification among the&#160;<em>Mustelus&#160;</em>or ‘tollo’ complex of the Eastern Pacific is problematic and little species-specific information is available; information on catches and population trends are therefore inferred from the broad species-group. Eastern Pacific smoothhounds (tollo) face considerable fishing pressure over much of their range and are captured in small-scale and large-scale gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries and are marketed for their meat.&#160;In Colombia and Ecuador, tollo is landed in very large quantities. In some areas fishing effort is increasing, and most fisheries are unregulated or poorly-regulated.&#160;<br/><p>In Guatemala, tollo are captured in artisanal gillnet and industrial longline fisheries, the former catching mostly juveniles and the latter, mostly adults; there has been an increase in fishing effort since 1996 (Ixquiac Cabrera 2009). In Costa Rica, tollo are captured in demersal trawl and longline fisheries (Clarke&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Clarke&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018) and in a productivity analysis from Costa Rica, the Sicklfin Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus lunulatus</em>) was considered the third most vulnerable species captured in the industrial demersal trawl fishery (Clarke<em> et al. </em>2018).

Halaelurus natalensis,"The Tiger Catshark is a discarded bycatch of demersal trawl, longline, beach seine, gillnet, and squid fisheries (Booth and Hecht 1998, Best <em>et al.</em> 2013, da Silva <em>et al. </em>2015). It is also caught in recreational line fisheries (van der Elst 1979, da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). Fisheries operate throughout its range, but fishing effort in South Africa has decreased substantially over the past two decades (S. Fennessy, pers. comm., 20 April 2018). Intense trawl fishing exists in southern Mozambique (Jacquet <em>et al.</em> 2010, Benkenstein 2013), although this accounts for only a minor part of this species' range. The Tiger Catshark has tended to move northeast within South Africa over three decades from 1981–2016, from the wide  shelf area of Agulhus Bank to the narrower shelf area to the east (Currie <em>et al.</em> 2019). This shift is concurrent with a reduction in the probability of encounter in the DAFF research trawl surveys (Supplementary Information Figure 2). The range shift and reduction in likelihood of encounter are likely at least partially related to climate change (Rouault <em>et al. </em>2010, Blamey <em>et al.</em> 2015), as the interaction with fisheries does not appear substantial enough to be causing the reduction (C. da Silva, unpubl. data, 2018).

It is also targeted with spearguns by artisanal fishers. Additionally, the Shorttail Nurse Shark is susceptible to coral reef habitat degradation and loss due to climate change, coral mining, and dynamite fishing (Katikiro and Mahenge 2016). Dynamite fishing is prevalent along the entire Tanzanian coastline (Braulik <em>et al.</em> 2015), and the practice has been recorded in Madagascar (David <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Marine,Critically Endangered,Ginglymostomatidae
Galeus polli,"The African Sawtail Catshark has been reported as bycatch in demersal trawl fisheries in the northern (Guinea) and southern (Namibia and South Africa) parts of its range (Camara <em>et al. </em>2016, Mafwila 2017). The species may inhabit depths beyond the reach of some regional fishing activities.&#160;<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto <em>et al.</em> 2017, Moore<em> et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011).&#160;<br/><br/> There are currently three active mixed fishery&#160;bilateral agreements&#160;between the European Union and the West African nations of&#160;Morocco, Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau (European Commission 2020). These agreements,&#160;known as Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) involve payments to third party countries in exchange for access to marine resources and sectorial support aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries development in the partner countries. Under SFPAs, there are a number of European distant-water industrial vessels using demersal trawls to capture deep-water shrimps at depths of 150–850 m in Guinea-Bissau&#160;(Sobrino&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017) and at depths of 400–950 m in Mauritania (Fernandez Peralta <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Mauritania, there are&#160;demersal trawl fisheries for black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Merluccius polli</em>) that operate mainly at depths of 500–700 m (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2019). Demersal trawl and longline fisheries in southern Morocco target a number of demersal fish, including black hake and scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus</em>&#160;spp.). Trawl fishing there occurs mostly at depths of 500–800 m and longline fishing occurs at depths of 100–400 m (Cervantes&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In the Mauritanian trawl fisheries, unidentified deep-water sharks and rays have accounted for approximately 10% of landings (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019), and in Morocco, there has been a fluctuating but increasing trend in deep-water shark landings from 0.2 t in 2007 to 17.8 t in 2017 (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 2018). Further information on bycatch species in these fisheries is largely unknown.&#160;<br/><br/> There are also an estimated 518 Chinese distant-water vessels registered in Africa; most (480) vessels fly flags from&#160;West Africa between Morocco and Gabon and most (426) are trawlers&#160;(Gutiérrez<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2020).&#160;Fishing effort is widespread, often takes place in deep offshore areas, and some&#160;“high intensity” areas have been identified off Guinea to Sierra Leone and off the Congo (Gutiérrez<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2020). Virtually nothing is known about these fishing activities.&#160;<br/> <br/> West Africa has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and IUU fishing by large industrial trawlers has contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (Daniels <em>et al.</em> 2016).

Mustelus minicanis,"The Venezuelan Dwarf Smoothhound is captured in intense and largely unmanaged commercial and artisanal trawl and longline fisheries. Industrial shrimp trawling in shallow coastal waters (operating at ~20–40 m depth) began off the Caribbean coast of Colombia in the mid-1960s and expanded until the 1980s when overfishing began (Wielgus <em>et al. </em>2010). In the mid-2000s this fishery had one of the highest ratios of bycatch relative to target species of any in the world, although this species was not recorded (Duarte <em>et al.</em> 2010). In Venezuela, commercial and artisanal fisheries are intense, unmanaged, and have exhibited the peaks in catches followed by declines indicative of sequential overfishing (Mendoza 2015). Industrial trawling for shrimp and demersal species was introduced in the 1940s there and increased rapidly from the 1960s until the 1980s when there were 450 registered vessels (Mendoza 2015). Fishing intensity increased for several decades and peaked at ~9,000 t in the 1990s (Manickchand-Heileman <em>et al.</em> 2004). Efforts to address over-exploitation and conflicts with artisanal fisheries led to a reduction to 260 vessels in 2006, and an industrial trawl ban went into effect in 2009 (Mendoza 2015). Industrial fleets of vessels that fish with longlines and handlines  operate there and also venture further afield to the Guianas and as far  as northern Brazil (Mendoza 2015).&#160;<br/><br/>Smoothhounds in general are targeted and highly valued in Venezuela, and this species is caught in large numbers in places such as Margarita Island (Tagliafico <em>et al. </em>2017). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth<em> et al. </em>2001). In French Guiana, shrimp trawl fisheries began in the 1960s with foreign vessels from the US and Japan which were then replaced in the 1980s by French vessels. Effort peaked in the mid-1990s and has declined since, but it is suspected that this may be largely due to changing environmental conditions that no longer favor shrimp recruitment in these waters (Chaboud and Thébaud 2009, Sanz <em>et al. </em>2017). There are also commercial artisanal and subsistence fisheries along the entire coast of French Guiana (Harper <em>et al.</em> 2015). Overall, this houndshark is subjected to intense fishing pressure across its range that is inadequately managed, and it has no refuge at depth. Other smoothhounds that are fished are often able to withstand well-managed fishing pressure, however in other areas that lack management their stocks have collapsed (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Colloca<em> et al. </em>2017).",Marine,Endangered,Triakidae
Centrophorus tessellatus,"<p>This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. Like other gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus</em> spp.), it is presumably taken as a target catch and bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple gears including deep-water demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet, and retained for the meat, fins, and liver oil.</p>In Japan, the sympatric Dwarf Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus atromarginatus</em>) was targeted for its liver oil in Suruga Bay, Honshu with deep-water longlines (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). It was also taken as bycatch of demersal gillnets and retained for the meat and fins (McCormack and White 2009). The Mosaic Gulper Shark occurs in the same area and was likely also targeted and taken as bycatch and retained. It could be currently captured in Suruga Bay by demersal gillnets that target fish and crustaceans at depths of 100–500 m. A deepwater dropline fishery for Splendid Alfonsino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) operates around the islands and seamounts south of Sagami Bay at depths of 400–800 m (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019) and may capture this species. Elsewhere in its Japan range, it may be captured by demersal trawl fisheries that operate at depths of 200–800 m (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Fisheries developed rapidly in Japan during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). <a name=""_Hlk22884015""></a><a name=""_Hlk21438533""></a>Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013 (FAO 2019, Helgil 2019). <br/><p></p><p>In the Maldives, targeted <em>Centrophorus</em> fishing for the liver oil was intense during the 1980s to the early 1990s when the collapse of the stocks led to the cessation of the fishery (Jabado <em>et al.</em> 2017). There has been no targeted shark fishing in the Maldives since 2010. In Hawaii, the Mosaic Gulper Shark is known from O'ahu at 260–370 m (Mundy 2005). It is possibly captured in the demersal fish fishery operating in the  Hawaiian Archipelago that targets deep-water snappers and groupers (<em>Etelis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Pristipomoides</em>&#160;spp.) at depths &lt;400 m (DLNR 2019). From the 1960s to the 1980s, the&#160;Southern Emperor Seamounts and Northern Hawaiian Ridge were heavily exploited by Japanese and Russian industrial vessels targeting Alfonsino&#160;(<em>Beryx splendens</em>) and&#160;Armourhead (<em>Pseudopentaceros wheeleri</em>) (Shotton 2016). Trawl and longline fishing generally occurred at depths 300–400 m, and Japanese gillnet fisheries operated at depths of 300–1,300 m (Shotton 2016). These fisheries ceased within the Hawaiian  Archipelago after the declaration of the United States Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) in 1977 (Clark&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2007, Baco <em>et al.</em> 2019), however, the effects of historic fishing effort, if any, on the species is unknown.</p>",Marine,Endangered,Centrophoridae
Somniosus microcephalus,"<p>Historically, this species has been targeted for its liver oil since the 13th century in Norway, and from the 14th century in Iceland, with target catches peaking in the early 1900s and ending in the 1940s–1960s. There has been increase in fisheries for liver oil since the 17th century and target catches of Greenland Shark have been significant over the past three centuries (at least two generation lengths). Target fishing pressure increased up to the 1900s, peaking and largely ending in the 1940s with the development of synthetic oils. The fishery in Greenland commenced in the early 19th century and by 1857 the estimated catch was 2,000–3,000 individuals per year. Thereafter, the fishery expanded until the beginning of the 1890s and catches increased to 11,500–15,000 growing to 32,000 individuals per year by 1910 (Jensen 1914). Peak catch was of an estimated 58,000 individuals annually based on reported production of 2.8 million kg of liver oil in Norway in 1948 (MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Commercial fishing of Greenland Shark for liver oil ceased in the 1960s along with the cessation of export of liver oil and skin from Greenland&#160;(Hedeholm&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). During the 1970s, the species was perceived as a problem for other fisheries in western Norway and the government subsidized a fishery in order to reduce the stock of the species (Castro<em>&#160;et al. </em>1999). Target artisanal fisheries still occur in Greenland and Iceland, with the catch averaging 25 t annually in Iceland since 2005 (ICES-WGEF 2018).&#160;</p><p>More recently, since the 1960s, this species was threatened by bycatch in industrial fisheries. Greenland Shark has been taken as bycatch of trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries in the Arctic Ocean and off Canada and the USA since the 1960s (Benjamins <em>et al. </em>2010) and Barents Sea (Rusyaev&#160;and Orlov 2013). Approximately 3,500 individuals are taken as bycatch each year in the Atlantic and Arctic Ocean and Barents Sea (see Supplementary Information 1). While little is known of discard mortality is it likely to be much lower from longlines through ice than from deep-water trawls (D.W. Kulka pers. obs. 2020). However, higher mortaltiy may occur when longline gear wraps the tail too tightly cutting off circulation causing the tail to die and when longline hooks pull through, breaking the jaw, when the shark surfaces (N.E. Hussey pers. comm. 26/08/2020).&#160;Based on recent observations by fishery observers, more than 1,000 individuals are caught annually from Arctic waters (NAFO Subarea O) south to USA waters (NAFO Subarea 6) (Bryk&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018,&#160;Hedeholm&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018,&#160;Hendrickson 2018, Hendrickson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018, Simpson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018,&#160;Wheeland and Devine 2018). Bycatch of Greenland Shark was likely higher historically in waters south of the Arctic given much higher levels of effort. Annual catch of Greenland Shark from the Barents Sea was estimated to be 1,200 individuals per year, based on catch weight of 140–150 t (Rusyaev and Orlov 2013). In the Canadian Arctic, Greenland Shark was mainly a discarded bycatch in demersal shrimp trawls before the introduction of the Nordmore grate. It is now only a bycatch in the Greenland halibut demersal trawl fisheries&#160;with some catch in gillnets, longlines, and setlines in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait, on the Labrador shelf since the 1990s (based on observer data, M. Treble, unpub. data 2019, D.W. Kulka unpubl. data 2019). Catches rose to peak at 800 t in 1990, before declining to 100–200 t between 2002–2008 with a more recent decline to 100 t due to shifting fishing patterns towards the target species (MacNeil&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2012). Greenland sharks captured by demersal longlines can become entangled with the mainline tightly wrapped around the caudal peduncle complicating release efforts. There are cases of persecution in Iceland and Canada where the tails have been cut off before the animal is returned to the water (Davis <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Norwegian vessels take Greenland Shark as bycatch in the halibut longline fishery of the Northeast Atlantic and livers occasionally harvested from discarded carcasses (C.F. Cotton pers. obs. 2004).&#160;The distribution and carrying capacity of Greenland Shark is likely to be affected by anthropogenic climate change, which is affecting the quantity, dynamics, and distribution of Arctic sea ice (Edwards&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). With few exceptions, Greenland shark is primarily found in the seas around the Arctic polar icecap and in continental and insular fjord ecosystems (Walter&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). While poorly understood, the rate of projected loss of sea ice will have and will continue to negatively influence the abundance, distribution and availability of prey (Edwards&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The climate-change induced reduction in Arctic sea ice is providing greater access for fishing fleets (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2019). Climate change has warmed mean summer sea surface temperatures by approximately 0.7<sup>o</sup>C per decade from 1982—2017, very likely resulting in a recent reduction in extent of sea ice extent of 3.5–4.1% per decade from 1979 to 2012 (Stocker <em>et al. </em>2013). Overall, there has been a ~50% reduction in summer sea ice extent since 1850 (Walsh <em>et al. </em>2017). Sea ice is projected to decline by at least a further 50% over the next 100 years (IPCC 2019). Consequently, existing demersal longline, trawl and gillnet fisheries for Northern Shrimp (<em>Pandalus borealis</em>) and Greenland Halibut (<em>Reinhardtius h</em><em>ippoglosoides</em>) are expanding northwards into previously unfished habitats and fishing seasons are lengthening allowing sustained effort for longer periods (Edwards <em>et al.</em> 2019). Further, there is greater potential for new fisheries to develop as more productive and abundant southerly species invade the warming Arctic waters (Tai <em>et al.</em> 2019). These newly developing fisheries are reportedly catching greater numbers of sharks and skates, particularly Greenland Shark (Davis <em>et al.</em> 2013). The common bycatch of Greenland Shark in some western Greenland fisheries has led to the proposal to once again use them as a biofuel (Davis <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>",Marine,Vulnerable,Somniosidae

Etmopterus perryi,"The threats to this species are poorly known because its distribution is not fully understood. This species seems to be readily catchable in trawl fishing gear. A 2009 research trawl study off Caribbean Colombia found this species in 39% of trawls, and it made up just over 1% of abundance and biomass (Paramo<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2012). Deepsea fishing has not yet developed in the Colombian Caribbean, however there is increasing interest in developing a fishery at depths of 200–550 m for deep-water cardinalfish (<em>Epigonus</em>&#160;spp.) which are targeted by trawl and longline in other ocean regions (e.g. Australasia and the Northeast Atlantic) (Paramo 2011, Paramo&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The development of any fishery should be monitored as this species may be susceptible to being caught as bycatch in such a fishery. There is potential for this species to be taken as bycatch in Venezuela, where there are deep-water bottom longline snapper and grouper fisheries operating on the outer continental shelf and upper slope (Mendoza <em>et al.</em> 2003).&#160;In Venezuela, there are three deepsea fisheries in operation. The first deepsea fishery is on the central coast which has a very narrow continental shelf, and where for the last 20 years there have been at least two main deepsea fishery landing sites with varying number of boats operating longline, seines, and traps at depths of 200–800 m, 4–6 days a week. These fisheries target demersal and pelagic bony fishes.&#160;The second deepsea fishery has been operating off northeast Venezuela on the continental slope of Margarita and La Blanquilla Islands at depths ranging from 200–600 m for the past 12–15 years. Demersal shark and ray species are not targeted there but are encountered as bycatch.&#160;Finally, the third deepsea fishery operates on a smaller scale with gillnets and longlines in eastern Venezuela on the Paria Peninsula shelf, with fewer than 30 boats which are used for a variety of activities including fishing. This is the most recent deepsea fishery to develop and has only been operational for the past 5 years. Further research is needed to determine if and how much these fisheries capture this shark.",Marine,Least Concern,Etmopteridae
Etmopterus princeps,"This shark is captured in demersal trawl and longline fisheries. In the northwest Atlantic, there is some bycatch in the Greenland Halibut (<em>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</em>) fishery in Canada (C.F. Cotton and D.W. Kulka unpubl. data 2019); however, most of the population there is distributed below 1,500 m and thus is deeper than most fishing effort (D.W. Kulka unpubl. data 2019). This shark was present in about 5% of catches in deepwater longlines off the Canary Islands (Pajuelo <em>et al.</em> 2010). Although deepwater sharks are typically less capable of withstanding fishing pressure due to their life history characteristics (Simpfendorfer and Kyne 2009), this shark inhabits waters beyond the reach of fisheries in most parts of its range and thus has refuge. There are no other potential threats.",Marine,Least Concern,Etmopteridae
Etmopterus virens,"<p>No target fishery exists and there is very little information available on bycatch of this species. However, it may be caught in the shallower part of its depth range on the outer continental shelf.&#160;It is not reported in the bycatch of deepwater longlines that target gag grouper, tilefish, and other reef fish in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulak and Carlson 2013).&#160;It is a possible bycatch of the royal red shrimp trawl fishery in the US Gulf of Mexico that operates at depths of 250–550 m (Stiles <em>et al.</em> 2007, Driggers <em>et al.</em> 2015). Trawling occurs on relatively restricted fishing grounds adjacent to home ports (Stiles <em>et al.</em> 2007). Observer coverage has also been low (Scott-Denton <em>et al.</em> 2012) and little information is available on bycatch.

Mustelus palumbes,"The Whitespot Smoothhound is caught as bycatch in demersal trawl,  line, and gillnet fisheries, and by recreational fishers, and may be discarded or retained for the meat and fins (da Silva <em>et al. </em>2015, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Fishing effort in some South African fisheries has been decreasing over the last decade (e.g. trawl fishing effort; recreational shore line fishing as a result of a 2002 ban on all-terrain vehicles on beaches), and  parts of Namibia are remote with very little fishing pressure (Belhabib <em>et al. </em>2015, da Silva <em>et al. </em>2015). Although intense trawl fishing exists in southern Mozambique (Jacquet <em>et al.</em> 2010, Benkenstein 2013), this accounts for only a minor part of this species' range.

Bythaelurus canescens,"The Dusky Catshark is a regular bycatch of deep-sea teleost and crustacean fisheries, especially the deep-sea shrimp (<em>Heterocarpus reedi</em>) trawl fishery off central and northern Chile, where it is the second most abundant shark in the bycatch (González 2001, Acuña and Villarroel 2002,&#160;Acuña <em>et al.</em> 2005), as well as Patagonian Toothfish (<em>Dissostichus eleginoides</em>), Pink Cusk-eel (<em>Genypterus blacodes</em>), and Yellownose Skate (<em>Dipturus chilensis</em>) longline fisheries off southern Chile (Bustamante <em>et al.</em> 2014). There is no information on bycatch of this species in Peruvian fisheries. Damage to critical egg-laying habitat (deep-sea corals) from demersal trawling and longlines is a significant concern (Häussermann and Försterra 2007, Concha&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).",Marine,Vulnerable,Pentanchidae
Mustelus whitneyi,"The Humpback Smoothhound is taken as bycatch of inshore artisanal gillnet fisheries and trawl fisheries&#160;in Santa Rosa (Santa Elena province)&#160;Ecuador (A. Cevallos unpubl. data) and as part of a target gillnet fishery for tollo in Peru (Gonzalez-Pestana<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019). In Ecuador, there are no reported landings, but this species is likely to be landed and sold locally under the same name. Its abundance decreases towards the south, and consequently the Chilean tollo fishery probably catches only Speckled Smoothhound (<em>M. mento</em>), which has a more southern distribution. Thus, the Peruvian fishery constitutes the main threat. Tollo has been heavily fished off Peru for over 30 years. This species is a major component of artisanal gillnet catches comprising 18% of the overall elasmobranch catch (Córdova-Zavaleta<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2016). Further, this species is incidentally captured and discarded at sea by the Peruvian hake trawl fishery (Céspedes 2013). In general, the artisanal fishery effort has increased with increased demand for this species as a result of human population growth in the region (Alfaro-Shigueto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).&#160;In Peru, fishing effort has been rising rapidly with a 35% increase in fishers and a 54% increase in vessels between 1995–2005. Further, Peru has one of the largest gillnet fisheries in the world&#160;(Alfaro-Shigueto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010), hence, stable or declining catches are most likely to reflect a reduction in population size.&#160;There is no refuge from fishing at depth for this shark.<br/><br/>This species’ threat is compounded by declines being masked by an aggregate product category. Throughout the region, tollo is a shark meat product category comprised of Blue Shark (<em>Prionace glauca</em>), Speckled Smoothhound (<em>M. mento</em>), Humpback Smoothhound (<em>M. whitneyi</em>) and Spotted Houndshark (<em>Triakis maculata</em>). The composition of this product varies seasonally and geographically, and the key concern is that high demand is buoyed up by the large seasonal landings of Blue Shark. In the months when Blue Shark is less accessible, this product category comprises the less abundant and less productive smoothhounds and houndshark, driving unsustainable pulses of largely unmonitored and unregulated fisheries. The capture and reporting of catches in bulk species categories has repeatedly been shown to mask the decline of the less abundant and less productive species (Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2000, Bornatowski <em>et al. </em>2013, Bornatowski&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). Further, seasonal demand is driven by religious holidays. For example, peak consumption of tollo may be associated with Easter in Peru, where there is high demand for 'Bacalao', which was traditionally salted Atlantic Cod (<em>Gadus morhua</em>), but is now mainly Blue Shark and smoothhounds. Any of the coastal species are captured and marketed under this aggregate&#160;product category.<br/><br/>Overall, this smoothhound is subject to intense, increasing, and unmanaged fishing pressure, and it has very little if any refuge at depth.",Marine,Critically Endangered,Triakidae
Oxynotus centrina,"The Angular Roughshark is infrequently reported as bycatch across its range in demersal trawl and longline fisheries (Ragonese <em>et al.</em> 2013, Ferretti<em> et al.</em> 2013). The species may be susceptible to capture because of its unique shape. It is often discarded (Ragonese <em>et al. </em>2013) and post-release survival may be high (Koehler 2018).&#160;<br/><br/>The Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean have been subject to extensive and intensive deep-water fishing across the entirety of the species' known depth and spatial distribution (Soldo and Guallart 2015, Soldo and Guallart 2016). In the Northeast Atlantic, there were a number of demersal trawl and longline fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope (Gordon 1999, ICES-WGEF 2019). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, deep-water sharks are still captured occasionally in demersal fisheries (e.g. Moura&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). In the Mediterranean, the Gulf of Lions region, for example, was initially exploited by small-scale demersal trawl fisheries, comprising 27 small low-powered boats (total nominal horsepower of 2,700 hp); by 1974−1987 effort had increased seven-fold to a total nominal horsepower of 19,940 hp (Soldo and Guallart 2015). &#160;<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>There are currently three active mixed fishery&#160;bilateral agreements&#160;between the European Union and the West African nations of&#160;Morocco, Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau (European Commission 2020).

In the Mauritanian trawl fisheries, unidentified deep-water sharks and rays have accounted for approximately 10% of landings (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2019). Demersal trawl and longline fisheries in southern Morocco target a number of demersal fish, including black hake and scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus&#160;</em>spp.).

Tanaka pers. comm. 28/08/2019) and may capture this species. If susceptible to capture in gillnets, it may be taken in Suruga Bay by demersal gillnets that target fish and crustaceans at depths of 100–500 m (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 28/08/2019).</p><p> Fisheries developed rapidly in Japan during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019). </p><p>In Taiwan, this species was captured and retained by commercial longlines operating off Cheong-gong, Taitung, southeast Taiwan. Deep-water longlines operate on the east coast of Taiwan, targeting mostly tuna with all incidental shark catch retained and marketed. The longline fishery likely began during the 1980s, and mostly operated at depths of 100–300 m, though catches of this species and other deep-water species indicate that the fishery has moved into deeper waters (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013a, H. Ho and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Kuo and Booth 2011, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H.

Hemitriakis complicofasciata,"The Ocellate Topeshark is subject to fishing pressure on its inshore shelf habitats. It is likely taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, longline, and gillnet. All incidental catch in Taiwan is retained for the meat for human consumption or for fish meal production for aquaculture. In Japan, it is likely this species is retained as its relative, the Japanese Topeshark (<em>Hemitriakis japanica</em>) is retained for its meat.<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Seine nets and demersal trawls are the main gear types, accounting for 46% and 19% of the total coastal and offshore fisheries catch, respectively, followed by longline (7%) and gillnet (4%) (Fisheries Agency 2019). Demersal trawling operates to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita  fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu <em>et al.</em> 2014, Helgil 2019a). <a name=""_Hlk21689450"">Fish  too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish  meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity  of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC  2016).</a><a name=""_Hlk21689450""></a><br/><a name=""_Hlk21689450""><br/></a><a name=""_Hlk21689450""></a><a name=""_Hlk21689450""></a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">  </a><a name=""_Hlk21689450"">  In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015).

Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019).

Etmopterus spinax,"The Velvet Belly Lanternshark is reported as incidental catch in deep-water demersal trawl, longline, and handline fisheries across its range (Fauconnet<em> et al.</em> 2019, ICES-WGEF 2019). The Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean have been subject to extensive and intensive deep-water fishing across much of the species' known depth and spatial distribution (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2009). Relative abundance of the Velvet Belly Lanternshark was highest at depths of 400–750 m (Ragonese<em> et al. </em>2013, Neat <em>et al.</em> 2015, ICES-WGEF 2019). In the Northeast Atlantic, there were a number of demersal trawl and longline fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope (Gordon 1999, ICES-WGEF 2019). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in demersal fisheries (e.g. Moura&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2018). Discard mortality is unknown, but is likely to be high based on severe injuries obtained when individuals are captured (Coelho<em> et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walke<em>r&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (Diop and Dossa 2011, CCLME 2016, Seto&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Moore<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005, Diop and Dossa 2011).&#160;<br/> <br/>There are currently three active mixed fishery&#160;bilateral agreements&#160;between the European Union and the West African nations of&#160;Morocco, Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau (European Commission 2020). These agreements,&#160;known as Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) involve payments to third party countries in exchange for access to marine resources and sectorial support aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries development in the partner countries. Under SFPAs, there are a number of European distant-water industrial vessels using demersal trawls to capture deep-water shrimps at depths of 150–850 m in Guinea-Bissau&#160;(Sobrino<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2017) and at 400–950 m in Mauritania (Fernandez Peralta<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2019). In Mauritania, there demersal trawl fisheries for black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>Merluccius polli</em>) that operate mainly at depths of 500–700 m (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). In the Mauritanian trawl fisheries, unidentified deep-water sharks and rays have accounted for approximately 10% of landings (Fernandez Peralta&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2019). Demersal trawl and longline fisheries in southern Morocco target a number of demersal fish, including black hake and scabbardfish. Trawl fishing here occurs mostly at depths of 500–800 m and longline fishing occurs at depths of 100–400 m (Cervantes<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018). Further information on bycatch species in these fisheries is largely unknown.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/> There are also an estimated 518 Chinese distant-water vessels registered in Africa; most (480) vessels fly flags from&#160;West Africa between Morocco and Gabon and most (426) are trawlers&#160;(Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020).&#160;Fishing effort is widespread, often takes place in deep offshore areas, and some&#160;“high intensity” areas have been identified off Guinea to Sierra Leone and off the Congo (Gutiérrez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Virtually nothing is known about these fishing activities.&#160;<br/> <br/> West Africa has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and IUU fishing by large industrial trawlers has contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (Daniels&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2016). Of the stocks assessed in the Eastern Central Atlantic, most are either overexploited or are fully exploited and are fished at levels that are not sustainable&#160;in the short term (FAO 2020).",Marine,Vulnerable,Etmopteridae
Triakis scyllium,"<p></p><p>  </p><p>The Banded Houndshark is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, longline, set net, and gillnet. It is retained for human consumption across its range except in some parts of Japan where it is possibly discarded. Small mesh sizes are used in nets throughout this species' range. This species is a more popular bycatch in Japan since the near–disappearance of the more desired Starspotted Smoothhound (<em>Mustelus manazo</em>) from southern Japan over the last two decades.<br/></p>  <p>There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Banded Houndshark. In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al. </em>2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). In the Korean waters of the Yellow Sea there is intense trawl fishing pressure (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).</p>  <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In response to fish stock depletion, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante<em> et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p><p>In South Korea, the Banded Houndshark is a retained bycatch of trawl and gillnet fisheries throughout Korean coastal waters that target sculpin (<em>Cottus koreanus</em>) and flounder (<em>Paralichthys olivaceus</em>) (C-H.

In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered  overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the  Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters.

Historically, across Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015).

Somniosus rostratus,"The Little Sleeper Shark is taken incidentally in demersal trawl and longline fisheries across its range in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. The species may be reported under a generic code, or misidentified as a juvenile Greenland Shark (<em>Somniosus microcephalus</em>), and may be more widespread than currently known (C. Cotton, unpubl. data). Sleeper sharks (<em>Somniosus </em>spp) are known for their slow life histories, and the Little Sleeper Shark is susceptible to capture in the shallower half of its bathymetric range, where most of the population appears to occur. It appears to have a relatively small known range compared to other sleeper sharks, but the species will have refuge at depth and in the Western Central&#160;Atlantic (off Cuba) where there are no known deep-water fisheries.&#160;<br/><br/>The species has been reported as bycatch in fisheries targeting Black Scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus carbo</em>) off the Azores, although no further species-specific information is available&#160;(Heessen 2003).&#160;Along the Mediterranean coast of Spain, the Little Sleeper Shark has been caught regularly&#160;as incidental catch in demersal trawl fisheries targeting the Red Shrimp (<em>Aristeus antennatus</em>). This fishery includes 12–20 vessels fishing at depths between 500–800 m for at least the past 20 years (Guallart&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2013). In the western Mediterranean Sea, the species has also been reported in pelagic and mesopelagic longline fisheries targeting tunas and swordfish (Garibaldi 2015, de Loyola Fernández <em>et al. </em>2017). When caught incidentally, this shark is usually discarded at sea&#160;and post-release mortality is thought to be high (Guallart&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2013).",Marine,Least Concern,Somniosidae
Squalus japonicus,"<p>The Japanese Spurdog is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch by demersal trawl, longline, and possibly gillnet, and is retained (H.

Chen unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk21698750"">In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the  1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a  reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical  mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White  Paper 2015). </a><a name=""_Hlk22647605"">The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em>  2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight  decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ  declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003,  Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019a). </a><a name=""_Hlk21701990""></a><a name=""_Hlk21701973""></a>Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three  decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant  decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the  fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry  (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019a, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The  trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial  and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). Demand  for seafood in Japan and South Korea, is extremely high; at 53.7 kg and 53.5  kg per capita, respectively in 2013, the demand is higher than that of  neighboring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019a, Helgil 2019a).<br/><br/>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes,  and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a  reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’  effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman  and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now  consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still  retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The  northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish  stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer  shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the  1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value  fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in the EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The demand for seafood has always been high and is suspected to continue to be high in Taiwan with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019b). Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2016).<a name=""_Hlk21696013""> </a><br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding 30 years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). The demand for fish meal product for aquaculture is high, with the aquaculture industry in China contributing 62% of the world’s farmed fish (FAO 2019b, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al. </em>2013, FAO 2019b, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinya and Liu 2014).</p>",Marine,Endangered,Squalidae
Scyliorhinus torazame,"The Torazame Catshark is taken as bycatch in demersal trawl, gillnet, and  longline fisheries, and  discarded in Japan; it is possibly retained in China and Taiwan (Horie and Tanaka 2002). It is sometimes captured incidentally in Japan in large quantities (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2020, A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The species was previously noted as accounting for 40% of discarded fish in Yamaguchi Prefecture,  southern Japan (Horie and Tanaka 2002). Post release survival is likely high as catsharks are generally robust to capture. For other catshark species, short-term post release survival was found to be 78–98% in trawls and 100% in gillnets (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017).

Over 30% of the  catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but  are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al. </em>2015, Liang and  Pauly 2017). In the Korean waters of the Yellow Sea there is intense  trawl fishing pressure (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). The  northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish  stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer  shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the  1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value  fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).  </p><p>In China,  inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s,  following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the  preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The  number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the  late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in  vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit  effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large,  highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable  species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture  (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). </p>  <p>In response to fish stock depletion,  the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and  1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort,  including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual  closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel  buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al. </em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing  effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in  response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em>  2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China  is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood  products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish  consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p>  <p>In  Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to  the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to  11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Kuo and Booth 2011, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National  Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The artisanal  fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered  sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts  (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In Taiwan, the  demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption  similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014,  Helgil 2019a).&#160;</p>  <p>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the  1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a  reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical  mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White  Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by  approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.  </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight  decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined  slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et  al. </em>2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased  markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline,  mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and  vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and there is a lack of younger  people entering the industry (NMFT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed  to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high;  at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of  neighbouring China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019b). </p>  <p><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">Dramatic  levels of habitat loss in the region pose a threat. In the Yellow Sea  and Bohai Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land  reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all  intertidal habitat since the 1980s with 65% loss of one intertidal  habitat, tidal flats, since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). In both the  East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic  reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of  mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has  also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of  significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009,  Heileman 2009).</a></p>",Marine,Endangered,Triakidae
Centroscyllium ritteri,"<p>The species was possibly previously captured in a localized Suruga Bay fishery that targeted deep-water sharks for their squalene rich livers (Nakaya <em>et al.</em> 2009). However, that fishery is no longer active and the Whitefin Dogfish is now a discarded bycatch of commercial deep-water demersal trawl fisheries that operate off Hokkaido, Iwate, and Miyagi mostly at depths of 600 m but occasionally to 800 m (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). These fisheries target Atka Mackerel (<em>Pleurogrammus monopterygius</em>) and Pacific Cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>) (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Across Japan, demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The Whitefin Dogfish may also be a bycatch of other fisheries, however  it has not yet been reported from them. A deep-water dropline  fishery for Splendid Alfonsino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) operates  around the islands and seamounts south of Sagami Bay at depths of  400–800 m (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). An Alaska Pollock (<em>Theragra chalcogramma</em>)  fishery operates off the northwest coast of Hokkaido to depths of 500 m  within the northernmost part of this species' range (Y. Dyldin unpubl.  data 2019). Post release survival is unknown, but is possibly low (Nakaya <em>et al.</em> 2009).</p><p>The species may be captured in demersal trawl, line, and gillnet fisheries on the Emperor Seamounts and if captured is likely discarded (Nakaya <em>et al.</em> 2009). The Emperor Seamount fisheries have operated since 1967 and fished heavily during the 1960s to 1980s mostly at depths of 300–600 m (Baco <em>et al.</em> 2019). The fisheries currently operate mostly in the Southern Emperor seamounts, which encompass the southern limit of the range of this species and mostly operate at depths of 300–500 m. Some Japanese gillnets may operate at 300–1,300 m and an exploratory South Korea longliner operated at depths of 250–1,050 m in the mid-2000s  (CHM 2016, Shotton 2016, NPFC 2020). The demersal trawl fisheries mainly target North Pacific Armourhead (<em>Pentaceros wheeleri</em>) that occur at depths of 146–800 m and Splendid Alfosino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) that occurs at depths of 25–1,300 m (Froese and Pauly 2019, NPFC 2020).&#160;</p>",Marine,Least Concern,Etmopteridae
Poroderma pantherinum,"The Leopard Catshark is a bycatch of a range of fisheries, including longline, gillnet, beach seine, trawl, and commercial and recreational line (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). Trawl fishing effort in South Africa has decreased substantially over the past two decades (S. Fennessy, pers. comm., 20 April 2018). Shore line fishing effort has decreased over the last 16 years as a result of a 2002 South African ban on all-terrain vehicles on beaches. Although the Leopard Catshark is discarded, many fishers regard the species as a nuisance and persecute them as such, likely causing high post-release mortality (K. Gledhill, unpubl. data, 2018). When discarded without undue harm, post-release mortality is likely low, based on generally very low at-vessel and post-release mortality for catsharks (Ellis <em>et al. </em>2017). This species is used in the aquarium trade, and in 2005, there was a minor target fishery for <em>Poroderm</em>a species for the aquarium trade (Human 2006).",Marine,Least Concern,Scyliorhinidae
Centroscyllium fabricii,"In the Northwest Atlantic, this shark was taken as a discarded bycatch of industrial deepwater fisheries throughout its range. In Canada, this species was captured incidentally and discarded in trawls and gillnet fisheries but is no longer retained (Benjamins <em>et al</em>. 2010). The pattern of deepwater catch there increased until the mid-1990s and has declined thereafter. Starting in the 1960s (up to the mid-1980s) the Soviets and others developed a Grenadier (<em>Coryphaenoides rupestrus</em>) and Greenland Halibut (<em>Hippoglossoides reinhardtius</em>) fishery (Kulka 2012). The creation of the 200-mile limit limited access by foreign fleets and fishing effort declined as there was little Canadian demand for Grenadier, which had been depleted. Since then effort has reduced with most of the focus on still fishing Greenland Halibut at much lower effort (Kulka 2012). Black Dogfish may be taken from 600 m down to 1,500 m in the Canadian Greenland Halibut fishery and approximately 70 t were taken annually (between 1996–2005 and possibly subsequently, D.W. Kulka unpubl. data 2019) in fisheries centred on the Grand Banks (Kulka 2006). More specifically, for gillnets, the bycatch numbers from the Davis Strait to the Grand Banks were estimated in the hundreds of thousands of fish annually (Benjamins <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, this amount corresponds to only about 0.1% of the minimum estimated abundance of Black Dogfish in the Davis Strait, Labrador Shelf and Grand Banks. Furthermore, that portion of its depth range beyond the fishing footprint provides a refuge.<br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, this shark is taken as retained and discarded bycatch of industrial mixed trawl, deepwater gillnet and mixed and directed longline fisheries operating in the Northeast Atlantic (ICES 2005, 2013). French trawl fisheries historically took significant retained catch of this species with landings (mainly from Faroe Islands division Vb and northwest of Ireland sub-area VI) decreasing from about 250 t in 2000 to about 30 t in 2004 (ICES 2005). Many of these fisheries operate throughout much of this species' geographic range in this region, and bycatch pressure is likely to be significant. For example, off Iceland, at least 100 t of Black Dogfish were likely to be discarded by the commercial fishery for Greenland Halibut based on research trawl surveys (Jakobsdottir 2001). The species is occasionally taken as a bycatch off southern Africa, but generally occurs in deepwater beyond the hake fishery zone. It is not considered to be threatened by fisheries in the Southeast Atlantic; however the situation should be monitored if fisheries expand into deeper waters. There is little information on catches of this shark in the eastern central Atlantic, however, deepwater fisheries are limited in depth range and therefore it is likely to have considerable refuge at depth. There is no information available on post-release survival rate, nor the condition in which individuals are discarded after capture.<strong><br/></strong>",Marine,Least Concern,Etmopteridae
Carcharhinus albimarginatus,"The Silvertip Shark is caught globally as target but mostly incidental catch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with pelagic longlines and purse seines, gillnet and demersal trawl, and a range of artisanal gear. It is generally retained for the meat and large fins (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2021). Its migratory behaviour from the seafloor to shallow waters at night increases its susceptibility to capture in the pelagic tuna fisheries. Commercial at-vessel-mortality in pelagic longline fisheries is highly variable ranging from 15–47% (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017, White <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>Coral reef-associated species such as the Silvertip Shark are important  to fisheries in the Arabian Seas and adjacent waters and Western Indian Ocean region of East Africa and Madagascar.  In these regions, elasmobranchs are most commonly taken as bycatch in  non-target fisheries and in artisanal fisheries. For example, the  Silvertip Shark is one of the most frequently caught sharks in  traditional and artisanal fisheries of Madagascar and carcharhinids dominated the small-scale fisheries marine megafauna catches  (elasmobranchs, marine mammals, and sea turtles) across Kenya, Zanzibar,  and northern Madagascar from 2016–2017 (Cripps <em>et al.</em> 2015, Temple <em>et al.</em> 2019). Across the Western Indian Ocean (WIO),&#160;more than 60 million people reside within 100 km of the coast and there is great dependence on marine resources  for food and employment (Obura <em>et al.</em> 2017). Marine fisheries catch in the WIO reported to the Food and Agriculture  Organization (FAO) increased from the 1960s to the 1990s but have  levelled off since 1999 suggesting stocks are fully fished. Artisanal catches are underreported and most small-scale, artisanal, and  subsistence coastal fisheries within the Western Indian Ocean are  considered to be fully- or overexploited, especially where they are  found close to population centres. <br/><br/>The Silvertip Shark is landed in local markets in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea (SEAFDEC 2006, 2020; White 2007). In Papua New  Guinea, the species was taken in the longline  shark fishery  that operated until 2014 and accounted for 0.5% by number  of the shark catch young juveniles to large adults caught and retained, and is still caught by coastal fishers (White <em>et al. </em>2017, White <em>et al. </em>2019). It is not commonly landed in Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Queensland, Australia, the Silvertip  Shark is taken incidentally in very low numbers by managed commercial and recreational line fisheries that target  Coral Trout (<em>Plectropomus leopardus</em>; Heupel <em>et al</em>. 2009). The Silvertip Shark was previously taken by illegal fishers operating in northern Australian waters. The species accounted for 3.7% of fins by number of fins seized from Taiwanese vessels caught illegally fishing in Australia from 2006–2009 (Marshall 2011). However, the level of illegal catch since about 2009 has been relatively low and is typically conducted by small-scale fishers from neighboring countries. Most of these fishers operate close to Australia's maritime border and recently, these fishers have rarely come near to the Australian mainland, and Australia has a National Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing (Department of Agriculture 2023).",Marine,Vulnerable,Carcharhinidae
Paragaleus tengi,"The Straight-tooth Weasel Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, longline, and gillnet. All incidental catch is retained for human consumption or fish meal. There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Straight-tooth Weasel Shark.<br/><br/>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon<em> et al.</em> 2012). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al. </em>2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al. </em>2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<a name=""_Hlk22884618""><br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011).</a> The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Demersal trawling operates to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019a). <br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile EEZ (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 1/09/2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 1 /09/2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019b).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is likely taken in inshore fisheries that operate at depths of 5–20 m and use bottom longline, divers and traps (V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020).   Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). <br/><br/>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al. </em>2017).<a name=""_Hlk22807790""><br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with </a><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region.

Orectolobus japonicus,"This species inhabits rocky and coral reefs and as such, is taken mainly by hook and line. Where captured on commercial hook and line it is likely retained for human consumption. The Japanese Wobbegong is reported as taken by set nets, and possibly trawl, in Japan and retained (Compagno 2001, A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 30/06/2020). In Taiwan, there is a small hook and line fishery in southern waters that may capture this species; elsewhere the hook and line fishery is mostly recreational charters. The charters have increased in effort over the past 10 years with government incentives to convert from commercial fishing (Fisheries Agency 2019, H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). In China, hook and line is mainly used in artisanal and subsistence fisheries which have a high fishing pressure as they account for ~25% of the Chinese domestic catch (Pauly and Le Manach 2015). However, the rocky and coral reef habitat of this species is not prevalent along most of the Chinese mainland which reduces the likelihood of capture in many areas in China. In Viet Nam, this species is also captured occasionally as bycatch by trawl and bottom longline at depths of 50–120 m (V. Quang unpubl. data 2020). Viet Nam fisheries effort has increased markedly over the past two decades and most marine stocks are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020).<br/><br/>The Japanese Wobbegong's nocturnal habit provides refuge from daytime fishing pressure. Post release survival when discarded from hook and line fisheries is unknown, but it is high for other wobbegong species taken by gillnet (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include habitat destruction and degradation. In both the East and South China Seas, there has been degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020).",Marine,Least Concern,Orectolobidae

During the monsoon season, conditions preclude deep-water trawling and some trawlers operate in the shallower depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho pers. comm. 28/08/2019). Commercial deep-water longlines operate on the eastern coast of Taiwan, targeting mostly tuna with incidental catch of shark retained and marketed. The longline fishery likely began during the 1980s, and operates at depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho and H. Hsu&#160; pers. comm. 28/08/2019).<br/><p><br/></p><a name=""_Hlk23247606""></a>",Marine,Least Concern,Pentanchidae
Mustelus widodoi,"<p></p>The Whitefin Smoothhound is subject to fishing pressure across its spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, longline, and gillnet. All incidental catch is retained for the meat and fins. In Indonesia, this species is of low commercial value, and it is caught occasionally by demersal longliners off Bali and possibly Lombok. It possibly occurs deeper than the majority of fisheries, though more information is required. Trawl fishing is particularly intensive in Indonesia, for example, in the nearby Arafura Sea region (W.T. White pers. comm. 28 June 2010). In 2009, it was reported that 680 trawlers operated in the Arafura Sea and that catches in inshore waters had declined with vessels travelling further to maintain catches (Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). The number of fishers increased by 165% from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Indonesia has been the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years, with average landings reported to be over 100,000 t (Jaiteh <em>et al</em>. 2017) and worth an estimated $125 million USD in export (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018). Carcharhinids are commonly caught by demersal trawl and inshore demersal gillnet fisheries and commonly landed in local fish markets (White <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2006). Carcharhinids are landed in 90% of fisheries operating in Indonesia (Booth <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2018) and in some areas, over 50% of sharks landed are juveniles (Nawawi <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Significant fishing activity also occurs off the southwest coast of Sumatra, in the Indian Ocean. Aceh Province in Sumatra is thought to be Indonesia’s largest shark fishing province, in terms of the total number of fisheries taking sharks (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018). Smoothhounds (Mustelus spp.) are occasionally recorded in fisheries on the southwestern coast of Aceh, which may be the Whitefin Smoothhound. Some specialized shark longlines operate in Aceh province, with demersal longliners potentially overlapping with Whitefin Smoothhound geographic range. Smoothhounds (<em>Mustelus </em>spp.) are also recorded in elasmobranch fisheries in Muncar (East Java), which operate in the Bali strait (Winter <em>et al</em>. 2019). Tuna longlines, specialised shark longlines and gillnets all operate in this fishery; <em>Mustelus </em>spp are likely caught in specialised shark longlines (H. Booth Wildlife Conservation Society unpubl. data 2020). Thus, the level of exploitation of this species could be extremely high throughout the Indonesian portion of its range.<br/><br/>In Sabah, Malaysia this species is caught in trawl fisheries in the South China Sea. The trawlers fishing out of Kota Kinabalu typically fish at 60–70 m depth and hence this species may have some refuge at depth (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Sabah, due to the high number of unlicensed local and migrant small-scale fishers, fisheries landings are underreported by an estimated 2.5 times (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2009). Similarly, the number of small-scale fishers may be three times higher than the reported number, thus exploitation levels are far higher than reported.<br/><br/>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull <em>et al</em>. 2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas, IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Marine,Vulnerable,Triakidae
Parmaturus pilosus,"There is no specific information available on bycatch of this species. The Salamander Catshark is possibly a bycatch of Taiwan deep-water trawl fisheries that operate at depths of 300–700 m; these fisheries target multiple species of shrimp with all the incidental catch retained (D. Ebert pers. comm. 28/08/2019). It may be encountered and discarded by Japanese commercial demersal trawl fisheries that operate in the Okinawa Trough, near the Ryukyu Islands, to depths of 700 m (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). Two individuals were caught off northeast Taiwan by deep-water research longlines (Hsu <em>et al. </em>2013) and it may be captured by commercial deep-water longlines on the eastern coast of Taiwan that operate to depths of 300 m, though it has not been reported from that fishery. It may be captured by deep-water line in Japan. A deepwater dropline fishery for Splendid Alfonsino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) operates around the islands and seamounts south of Sagami Bay at depths of 400–800 m (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019).",Marine,Least Concern,Pentanchidae
Etmopterus decacuspidatus,"There is no specific information available on bycatch of this species. The Combtooth Lanternshark is unlikely to be taken by longline, as it is too small for the gear used in the area and unlikely to be taken by trawlers, as most commercial demersal trawls in China operate to a maximum depth of 300 m (X. Chen unpubl. data 2019). It has only been caught by a research survey to date suggesting interaction with commercial fisheries is limited, and it has refuge at depth from any possible fishing pressure.",Marine,Least Concern,Etmopteridae
Chiloscyllium burmensis,"<p>The Burmese Bambooshark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is regularly taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including by demersal inshore trawl, gillnet and line, and retained for human consumption (SEAFDEC 2016, Psomadakis&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Fishing effort and power has been increasing in the Asian region and is generally unregulated and unmanaged (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, Watson <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p><p>In India, this species is commonly found in landings in West Bengal (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In the Bay of Bengal, India has&#160;an intensive fishing fleet of trawlers and gillnetters throughout the region (&gt;23,000; K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).&#160;In India, shark fisheries peaked in the 1980s as the demand for meat and fins grew across southeast Asia (Karnad&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;There is high level of fisheries exploitation with most stocks fully exploited (FAO 2020). There were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al.</em> 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). Trawling is also intense elsewhere with 3,678 trawlers in Kerala and 5,767 trawlers in Tamil Nadu waters, with severe declines in fish stocks, including elasmobranchs (Raje <em>et al. </em>2002, Mohanraj&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, CMFRI 2010, Karnad&#160;<em>et al. </em>2014).</p><p>Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that has been increasing in recent decades with 67,669 vessels reported to be operating in 2017–2018 (DoF 2018, Pauly&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The artisanal fishing fleet operates at depths of 0–40 m on average (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014). Artisanal shark landings have increased from 2,000 t in 1986 to 6,234 t in 2001 (Ullah&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014).&#160;Industrial shark landings have increased three-fold from 400 t in 1986 to 1,247 in 2001 (Ullah&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. Since 2004 sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al.</em> 2020). The International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated of the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014. An indirect threat is the loss and degradation of habitats such as coastal mangroves. Southeast Asia has seen an estimated 30% reduction in mangrove area since 1980 (FAO 2007, Polidoro&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).</p><p></p>",Marine,Vulnerable,Hemiscylliidae
Mustelus manazo,"<p>The Starspotted Smooth-hound is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It was previously targeted and is now taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, longline, set net, and gillnet. Trawls and longline operate across the entire depth range of this species, while the other net fisheries likely operate in its upper depth range. All incidental catch is retained for human consumption, fish meal and liver oil. There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Starspotted Smooth-hound.<br/><br/>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). In the Korean waters of the Yellow Sea there is intense trawl fishing pressure (A. Yamaguchi pers. comm. 28/08/2019). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Bottom trawling operates to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019a). <br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01/09/2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01/09/2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019b). <br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is likely taken in offshore industrial demersal trawl and longline fisheries that operate at depths of 50–150 m (V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the Viet Nam range of the Starspotted Smooth-hound. Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020a). The industrial fleet began operating in Viet Nam's Exclusive Economic Zone in the early 1970s, but was very small until the mid-1980s when it expanded and then steadily increased to 53,000 vessels in 2014; there has been a steep rise in engine power over the past two decades (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020a). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020a, Helgil 2020a).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, inshore demersal stocks are considered overexploited with growth overfishing apparent (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020b). Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020b). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares <em>et al. </em>2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, bottom trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020b). <br/><br/>In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Kenya, fishing pressure has increased substantially from ~2000 fishers in 1950 to 13,100 in 2013 (FAO 2015, Le Manach<em> et al. </em>2015). Artisanal and industrial fisheries capture sharks at all life-stages (M. Samoilys pers. comm. 24/4/2018). <br/><br/><a name=""_Hlk22807790"">Dramatic levels of habitat loss in the region pose a threat. In the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s with 65% loss of one intertidal habitat, tidal flats, since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009). In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020a). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945 to 1995 (Jameson <em>et al. </em>1995).</a><a name=""_Hlk22807790""></a><a name=""_Hlk22807790""></a><a name=""_Hlk22807790""></a></p>",Marine,Endangered,Triakidae
Pristiophorus japonicus,"The Japanese Sawshark is a bycatch of demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries. It is particularly susceptible to capture in gillnets because of the thorns on the rostrum (Yamada <em>et al.</em> 2007). At-vessel-mortality for other sawsharks is 7–42% in gillnet fisheries (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is an uncommon catch of trawl fisheries operating in Suruga Bay, Japan (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). It is also captured occasionally at depths of 200–400 m by Japanese trawl fisheries in the East China Sea, and in western Kyushu and Kagoshima, Japan (Yamada <em>et al.</em> 2007, A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019). Across Japan, demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The species is a possible bycatch of deep-water trawl fisheries that operate off the northeast coast of Taiwan at depths of 300–700 m; these fisheries target multiple species of shrimp with all the incidental catch retained (D. Ebert pers. comm. 28/08/2019). It may be taken by Chinese trawlers that operate to a maximum depth of 300 m (X. Chen pers. comm. 28/08/2019).",Marine,Least Concern,Pristiophoridae
Halaelurus maculosus,"<p>The Indonesian Speckled Catshark is taken as target and bycatch of demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries. Members of the <em>Halaelurus</em> genus are reported as common in prawn trawl bycatch (White 2009, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Indonesia, the species is noted as caught irregularly by demersal longline fisheries that operate offshore, and occasionally caught by gillnet trammel net (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).  Fishers from Tanjung Luar, Lombok target sharks from southern Bali across the Flores Sea and to the Makassar Strait and Java Sea (Simeon <em>et al.</em> 2019). The Indonesian Speckled Catshark was also likely taken by trawl, though trawlers were banned  in 1980. Mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country but not in the area where the Indonesian Speckled Catshark occurs  (Chong <em>et al.</em> 1987. Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). In  Indonesia, fishing effort is intense and across all sectors has been  increasing since the 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s (Tull 2014).  Indonesia has the largest chondrichthyan  fishery globally, and  substantial catches of target and bycatch  chondrichthyans (White<em> et al.</em>  2006). It has been among the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years  (Oakes and Sant 2019). Many shark and ray species  are highly exploited  and stocks of most species in the Java Sea region have declined by at   least an order of magnitude (Blaber<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2009). </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>  <p></p><p>The Indonesian Speckled Catshark has been reported from several landing sites in the Philippines (White <em>et al.</em> 2007).

Rhizoprionodon longurio,"The Pacific Sharpnose Shark is captured as bycatch in demersal shrimp and hake trawl fisheries and in teleost traps, and is targeted by artisanal gillnets and longlines. These fisheries are generally intense in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific. Gillnet pressure in the Gulf of California is high and has led to declines in various marine species including pelagic sharks (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). There is a hake trawl fishery in the northeastern Gulf of California that likely captures this species<em></em>. Shrimp trawling is substantial off southwest Baja California Sur and also off Mazatlan, where declines in catches, overcapacity, and poor governance have been highlighted (Foster and Vincent 2010). In Guatemala, this species is landed commonly with a peak in November that includes neonates (C. Avalos unpubl. data 2019). In Costa Rica and Colombia, shrimp trawl fisheries have declined to the point of being unprofitable, indicating overfishing. In a vulnerability analysis of elasmobranchs in the Costa Rica shrimp  trawl fishery, this species was determined to be highly vulnerable (Clarke <em>et al. </em>2018). These sharks are caught frequently on bottom longlines in Costa Rica. Artisanal net fisheries operate across the species' South American  range, and there is little management in place. Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks, have been degraded as a result of coastal development and shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific (López-Angarita <em>et al. </em>2016). <br/><br/>Although this species is relatively productive and could probably withstand some fishing pressure, a lack of management and enforcement throughout most of its range precludes sustainability, and there is no refuge at depth. This shark may have some refuge from fishing in southern California and the relatively remote Pacific coast of Baja California.",Marine,Vulnerable,Carcharhinidae
Holohalaelurus punctatus,"The African Spotted Catshark is likely captured as bycatch by deep-water demersal trawl  fisheries. A crustacean trawl fishery operates off Durban, and extends northwards into southern Mozambique operating at depths of 100–600 m (Fennessy and Groenveld 1997).&#160;<em>Holohalaelurus</em> species from the KwaZulu-Natal and southern Mozambique region were still present in commercial fisheries landings as of 2008, but apparently only rarely and species identification was not being recorded (Human 2009). Effort, however, has been declining substantially since 2007; the 2016 effort level was half the 2012 level, which in-turn was only 30% of that in the early 1990s. Currently there are 2–3 vessels operating at any one time, for a total of around 1,000 trawls per year (S. Fennessy, pers. comm., 24 April 2018).  This species has been recorded rarely in both the Mozambique  deep-water trawl and longline fisheries (S. Fernando, pers. comm., 24 April 2018). Fishing pressure in  Madagascar is intense and increasing (Le Manach <em>et al.</em> 2012, Cripps <em>et al. </em>2015). The species may have refuge at depth in some parts of its distribution.",Marine,Endangered,Pentanchidae
Halaelurus buergeri,"There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Blackspotted Catshark and this species is subject to fishing pressure across its entire range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, seine net<em>, </em>gillnet, and torchlight net. Trawls operate across the entire depth range of this species, while the other net fisheries likely operate in its upper depth range. In Taiwan and Japan, and likely China, Korea and Borneo, it is retained for fish meal production for aquaculture.<br/><br/>In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since  the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries  during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly  2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from  ~10,000  in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an  increase  in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the   catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased  and large,  highly valued species have been replaced by small, less  valuable  species, with most of the catch now used as feed in  aquaculture  (MacKinnon<em> et al.</em> 2012). The demand for fish meal  product for aquaculture is high, with the  aquaculture industry in China  contributing 62% of the world’s farmed  fish (FAO 2019a, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government  introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been  modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized  trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear  regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing  vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However,  non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues  to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining  inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al. </em>2013, FAO  2019a, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and  increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products  globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was  evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<a name=""_Hlk22884015""><br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries  were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters  within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The  fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s  until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The</a>  number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone  significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late  1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200  vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries  Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal  fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered  sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts  (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu,  Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Seine nets and demersal trawls are the main gear types, accounting for 46% and 19% of the  total coastal and offshore fisheries catch respectively, followed by  longline (7%) and gillnet (4%) (Fisheries Agency 2019). <br/><br/>In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011, FAO 2019b). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019b, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01/09/2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01/09/2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high; at 53.7 kg&#160;per capita in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinya and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019).<br/><br/>In the Philippines, inshore demersal stocks are considered overexploited with growth overfishing apparent (Palomares and Pauly 2014, FAO 2020). Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares <em>et al.</em> 2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, bottom trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020). In the Philippines, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption increasing over the last two decades to 34.1 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2020). In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020).<a name=""_Hlk22807790""> Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include  coastal habitat destruction and degradation, and pollution (e.g. heavy  metals) (Heileman and Tang 2009, Heileman 2009, MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/></a>",Marine,Endangered,Pentanchidae
Galeus murinus,"In the Northeast Atlantic, there were previously a number of demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries targeting and incidentally catching mixed deepwater shark catch along the continental slope (Gordon 1999, ICES 2022). Since 2010, targeted deepwater shark fishing has been prohibited with subsequent prohibitions on fishing below depths of 200 m for gillnet and 800 m for trawl across most of the Mouse Catshark's Northeast Atlantic range. Despite these management measures to reduce deepwater shark fishing mortality, deepwater sharks are still captured occasionally incidentally in demersal fisheries (e.g., Moura <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Mouse Catshark's small size means that it could potentially escape from the mesh of trawls and its deepwater habitat likely precludes it from being taken in large numbers in Northeast Atlantic waters. The Mouse Catshark was an occasional bycatch of French deepwater trawling operating beyond 1,000 m depth off the British Isles in the 1990s–2010s. The species is apparently no longer caught by this fishery, which now limits their activities to less than 700 m (S. Iglesias unpub. data).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Central Atlantic, sharks and rays were already being exploited by semi-industrial fisheries in the 1950s (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005). While these fisheries gradually collapsed, the demand for dried salted shark meat (for export to Ghana) and shark fins in the 1980s drove the development of artisanal targeted shark fishing across much of the region (e.g., Diop and Dossa 2011, Moore <em>et al</em>. 2019). Over the years, this has expanded into targeted shark and ray fisheries across many countries and is likely increasing fishing pressure on this species (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2005, Diop and Dossa 2011). Mixed fishery bilateral agreements between the European Union and the West African nations (Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements, SFPAs) involve payments to third party countries in exchange for access to marine resources and sectorial support aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries development in the partner countries, including Morocco, Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau (European Commission 2023). Under SFPAs, demersal trawl and longline fisheries in southern Morocco target a number of demersal fish, including black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em> and <em>Merluccius polli</em>) and scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus</em> spp). Trawl fishing there occurs mostly at depths of 500–800 m and longline fishing occurs at 100–400 m (Cervantes <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Mouse Catshark would have significant refuge at depth in the Eastern Central Atlantic.",Marine,Least Concern,Pentanchidae

Atelomycterus baliensis,"The Bali Catshark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is rarely taken as bycatch in artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including by demersal inshore trawl, gillnet, line, and trammel nets, and retained for human consumption (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). Previously it was recorded as being caught irregularly by longline (small) and dropline fishers operating over hard substrates off of Jimbaran Bay (Bali) (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Fishing effort and power has been increasing in the Asian region and is generally unregulated and unmanaged (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Watson <em>et al</em>. 2013). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). A 165% increase in fishers occurred from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise a high majority (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). The number of fishers in Bali has declined in recent years as the area has transitioned to accommodate tourism (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>The Bali Catshark is likely to have some refuge from the majority of fishing activity throughout its range. This species spends much of its time on coral and rocky habitats where many fishing gears are unlikely to be deployed. This species is not targeted in any part of its range and if landed is likely as done so as bycatch.<br/><br/>Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5 °C (IPCC Report 2019).",Marine,Least Concern,Scyliorhinidae
Centroscyllium excelsum,"<p></p><p>The species may be taken as bycatch in demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries on the Emperor Seamounts. In 2019, half of the total number of recorded specimens (23 individuals) were captured by demersal trawl surveys at Lira Seamount at depths of 642<a name=""_Hlk23247743"">–</a>653 m (A. Orlov pers. comm. 20/10/2020). The Highfin Dogfish has been reported as bycatch by some members of the  North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC), however it is unknown if it is retained or discarded (J. Curtis, Scientific  Committee, NPFC pers. comm. 10/09/2020). If it is discarded, post-release survival is unknown, but is possibly low (Nakaya <em>et al.</em> 2009). The fisheries have operated since 1967 and fished heavily during the 1960s to 1980s mostly at depths of 300–600 m (Baco <em>et al.</em> 2019). The fisheries currently operate mostly in the Southern Emperor seamounts, which encompass the southern part of the known range of this species and mostly operate at depths of 300–500 m. However, some Japanese gillnets may operate at 300–1,300 m and an exploratory South Korea longliner operated at depths of 250–1,050 m in the mid-2000s (CHM 2016, Shotton 2016, NPFC 2020). The demersal trawl fisheries mainly target North Pacific Armourhead  (<em><em>Pentaceros</em> wheeleri</em>) that do not occur below depths of 800 m and Splendid Alfosino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) that occurs at depths of 25–1,300 m (Froese and Pauly 2019, NPFC 2020). The North Pacific Armourhead fisheries are unlikely to fish to the depths at which this species occurs, but the fisheries for Splendid Alfosino may interact with this species. The main fisheries for Splendid Alfosino in the Southern Emperor/Northern Hawaiian Ridge are on seamounts slightly further south than the range of this species, that is from 36°N (Yoko seamount) to ~30°N (Hancock seamounts) (Shotton 2016).&#160;</p>",Marine,Near Threatened,Etmopteridae
Squalus bassi,"The African Longnose Spurdog is suspected to be caught as bycatch in South African demersal trawl and longline fisheries (based on the information from regional congeners) (da Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015). Effort in the South African fisheries has declined substantially, particularly since the 2008 financial crisis when it became unprofitable for South African hake to be flown to European markets (S. Fennessy, pers. comm., 24 April 2018). This species is caught in deep-water trawls in Mozambique, where effort is intense, and recorded as the Shortspine Spurdog (<em>Squalus mistukurii</em>)<em>&#160;</em>(Jacquet <em>et al.</em> 2010, Benkenstein 2013, S.

Squalus mahia,"Little specific information is available on catches of the Malagasy Skinny Spurdog. It is possibly taken in a range of gears as small dogfishes are typically taken as bycatch by trawl, hook and line, gillnet, and fish trap (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2103). Heavy artisanal and industrial fishing occurs across most of this species' range, although it may have refuge at depth in some areas (Jacquet <em>et al. </em>2010, Benkenstein 2013, Cripps <em>et al.</em> 2015, da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015, Le Manach<em> et al</em>. 2015).

Squalus acanthias,"<p>The Spiny Dogfish is taken as targeted and incidental catch by hand line, demersal gillnet, trawl, dredge, and longline in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries. While targeted fishing pressure in the Atlantic Ocean has declined markedly, the species is still susceptible to capture as bycatch in multi-species fisheries (Rago and Sosebee 2014, da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015, ICES-WGEF 2018, FNZ 2019). Aggregative behaviour increases the catchability of mature (and usually pregnant) females (ICES-WGEF 2018). In European Union (EU) industrial fisheries, the species is generally discarded due to bans on retention, transshipment, and landing (e.g. ICES-WGEF 2018). Post-release mortality varies depending on handling techniques and gear type (e.g up to ~30% in trawl fisheries); at vessel mortality has been estimated as high as ~39% for gillnet fisheries (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p>Historically, the species has been intensively fished off Europe since the early 1900s (mainly in the North and Irish Seas), primarily by British and Norwegian fleets, and later by French and Irish fleets (Bonfil 1994). As of 2010, science-based regulations ended EU industrial fisheries targeting Spiny Dogfish in the Northeast Atlantic; landings are still reported from Norway (between 216–313 t annually since 2011) (ICES-WGEF 2018). Some ICES member countries may be reporting landings of the Spiny Dogfish under a generic name (e.g. <em>Squalus </em>sp.) In the Mediterranean, most targeted fishing ceased in the 1970s with the decline in stock; however, unregulated and incidental capture still occurs in the Mediterranean and Black Seas (e.g. Ţoţoiu <em>et al. </em>2016, Bonanomi <em>et al. </em>2018). In the Mediterranean, Spiny Dogfish is considered a bycatch species, but catches are fully commercialized (Serena<em> et al.</em> 2009b, Farrugio and Soldo 2013). Targeted fisheries in the Black Sea were once operated by Turkey, Russia, and Ukraine; following reductions of Spiny Dogfish stock in the region observed in the 1990s, most of the fisheries closed and today Bulgaria is the only country with a targeted fishery in the region (Shlyakhov and Daskalov&#160;<a>2008).</a></p>      <p>Landings of Spiny Dogfish from the Northwest Atlantic peaked in 1974 at ~25,000 t, and again in 1996 at ~28,000 t; the majority of landings between 1979–2000 were reported from the United States fisheries. <a>The driver behind these fisheries has been international trade to satisfy the European market demand (Dell'Apa&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;The species is currently not commercially fished in Canada, but is reported as bycatch in industrial and recreational fisheries (DFO 2020). </a>Spiny Dogfish is still fished commercially in U.S.waters, but according to the 2018 stock status update, the population is not currently overfished or subject to overfishing (NOAA 2019).&#160;</p><p>In Africa, Spiny Dogfish is infrequently reported (&lt;1 t between 2010–12) from South African industrial demersal longline fisheries, including those targeting sharks (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). Some African countries, particularly Mauritania, appear to be intensifying Spiny Dogfish fishing to supply the European&#160;market demand in recent years (FAO 2009, Dell’Apa<em> et al.</em> 2013).</p><p>In Argentina, the Spiny Dogfish is reported as bycatch in industrial fisheries (e.g. Cedrola <em>et al. </em>2012, Crespi-Abril <em>et al.</em> 2013). Catches have been difficult to monitor since the species may be misidentified, reported under a generic category of ""shark"", or processed at sea (making species identification not possible) and historically, the species was discarded for lack of commercial value (Chiaramonte 1998). Increased commercial landings of the species were first noted in the early 2000s after the collapse of Argentina's primary fishery, hake (<em>Merluccius hubbsi</em>). It has not been possible to estimate the volume of Spiny Dogfish landings, but it is known that the species is not as frequently landed as other regional sharks (Narrownose Smoothhound, <em>Mustelus schmitti</em>, and Tope, <em>Galeorhinus galeus</em>) (G. Chiaramonte pers. comm. 22/04/2020). Retention of the species is largely influenced by international market forces (Chiaramonte 2006).&#160;Increased exploitation from South American countries (e.g. Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile) is expected if European demand increases; exports of the species from Argentina increased after strict management measures began to take effect in the US around 2000 (Dell’Apa <em>et al. </em>2013). In Argentina, fisheries are characterized by declining catches, a shift to species of lower trophic levels, and an increase in catch coming from overexploited stocks (Pauly and Zeller 2015). Nearly two thirds of all Argentina stocks were overexploited or collapsed in 2014 (Pauly and Zeller 2015). The species is reported in both Chilean (SUBPESCA 2017) and Argentinian hake fisheries (Núñez <em>et al. </em>2018); the latter of which has 566 trawlers in operation.</p><p>In the Southwest Pacific, New Zealand data pre-1980 are unavailable, but landings were likely to be negligible given its low value (Francis 1998, FNZ 2019). Landings increased in the late 1980s and 1990s, but fluctuated considerably depending on market forces and the species availability and the amount of effort directed at target species (Francis 1998). Spiny Dogfish is one of the primary bycatch species in New Zealand offshore fisheries (Finucci <em>et al.</em> 2019) and the most reported chondrichthyan from New Zealand fisheries (Francis 2015). In Australia, the species has been reported from Tasmanian recreational gillnet fisheries (Fordham 2005), as well as industrial trawl, dropline, and longline fisheries; average annual industrial catch is low (&lt;4 t) and it is thought the species has minimal exposure to fishing gear (Walker and Gason 2007).&#160;&#160;</p><p>In addition to fishing activities, Spiny Dogfish may be threatened by habitat loss and degradation. Coastal development, pollution, dredging, and bottom trawling affect coastal or demersal habitat that the species’ prey relies on (ASMFC 2002). In Chile, spatial overlap of nursery areas and aquaculture farms have been identified; the effect of this interaction appears to influence the diet of the Spiny Dogfish, but any effect on the species' reproductive output is unknown (Gaitán-Espitia <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p>              </p>  <p></p>",Marine,Vulnerable,Squalidae

Squatina guggenheim,"The Angular Angelshark is threatened by being caught as bycatch in trawl and gillnet fisheries. Angel sharks lie motionless on the sea floor during the day but actively forage at night, and therefore they are highly susceptible to bottom-set gillnets that are set at night (Standora and Nelson 1977). The great increase of the annual angel shark catches in southern Brazil in 1992-1993 was due to a new fishery that targeted angel sharks specifically with bottom gillnets on the outer shelf (Klippel <em>et al.</em> 2005). Bottom gillnets were up to six times as effective as bottom trawls in terms of mean annual angel shark CPUE (Miranda and Vooren 2003, Vooren and Klippel 2005).<strong>&#160;</strong>After declines occurred as a result of trawl fisheries, the directed fishing with bottom gillnets was an additional threat to the Brazilian population of the Angular Angelshark. <strong><br/></strong><br/>Bottom trawling in Brazil targets an array of productive bony fishes, while elasmobranchs are caught as commercially valuable bycatch. Between 1985 and 2002, species such as the Angular Angelshark were overfished while the more productive species of fishes continue to sustain these fisheries (Miranda and Vooren 2003, Klippel <em>et al. </em>2005). <br/><br/><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>An angel shark bottom gillnet fishery on the outer shelf commenced  around 1990 and large amounts of angel shark were caught this  way until 2004 when the species became protected in Brazil (Miranda and Vooren 2003). <strong><br/></strong><br/>Chiaramonte (1998) stated that the angel sharks were the second most  important fish landed by the gillnet fleet of Puerto Quequen, Argentina.",Marine,Endangered,Squatinidae
Squatina formosa,"The Taiwan Angelshark is subject to fishing pressure across the entire range of its shelf and upper slope habitats. The species is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries by deep-water trawl, and possibly gillnet and longline, and retained for the meat and fins, and for fish meal. <br/><br/>By the 1950s, the Taiwan coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019, H.

It is suspected to be less at risk of capture in gillnet and set net fisheries than the Japanese Angelshark (<em>S. japonica</em>) as it is suspected of occurring deeper than the Japanese Angelshark (S.

The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011, FAO 2019a). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people moving into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019a, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan, and Korea, is extremely high; at 53.7 kg and 53.5 kg per capita, respectively in 2013, the demand is higher than that of neighbouring China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, FAO 2019b, Helgil 2019a). Although the high demand may lead to an increase in imports, it is assumed that it is also leads to ongoing pressure on domestic fisheries which in turn leads to ongoing threats to the Clouded Angleshark.<br/></a></p>  <p>In South Korea, fishing effort has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). It increased markedly from the 1970s and in the 1990s, when the number of fishing boats increased to 75,000 in 1996 and 81,000 in 1997, of which 70% were operating within Korean EEZ (Shon <em>et al. </em>2014). Many commercially important stocks rapidly became overfished and in response, the government decommissioned 16,800 boats by 2008, of which 10,400 were coastal boats (Shon <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>    <p>The Yellow Sea was once one of the most intensively exploited Large Marine Ecosystems in the world and is considered severely impacted in terms of overfishing, with destructive fishing practices (NOAA 2009). In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). </p>  <p></p><p>Additionally, market surveys in China (Hainan province) revealed that despite being caught as bycatch, demand is low for this species (the meat is considered low-quality) and it was observed being left to perish following landing (Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011). In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s (~2,000% increase), along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012). The demand for fish meal product for aquaculture is high, with the aquaculture industry in China contributing 62% of the world’s farmed fish (FAO 2019c, Rueter<em> et al.</em> 2019). </p>  <p>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al. </em>2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019c, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6% annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).</p>  <p>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters.

The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). Demersal trawls are one of the main gear types and operate to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. The trawl fishery targets multiple species of shrimp, uses small mesh sizes, and on southwest coast, has been intensive for a considerable time (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high and was 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2019). <a name=""_Hlk21689450"">Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2016).</a><br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species that now constitute more than 70% of the catch, and are mostly used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon<em> et al.</em> 2012, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for fish meal product for aquaculture is high, with the aquaculture industry in China contributing 62% of the world’s farmed fish (FAO 2019, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). In response to fish stocks depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al.</em> 2013, FAO 2019, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>In Viet Nam, this species is likely taken in offshore industrial demersal trawl, and possibly longline, fisheries that operate in depths of 50–150 m (V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the Viet Nam range of the Ocellated Angelshark. Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020). The industrial fleet began operating in Viet Nam's Exclusive Economic Zone in the early 1970s, but was very small until the mid-1980s when it expanded and then steadily increased to 53,000 vessels in 2014; there has been a steep rise in engine power over the past two decades (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020, Helgil 2020). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014, FAO 2020).<br/><br/>In Sabah and Sarawak, the Ocellated Angelshark is mostly caught by deep-water trawls that operate more than 60 nautical miles from the shore (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020)<span lang=""EN-AU"">.     There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al.</em> 2002, A.

The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from the 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011). Since then, it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000–232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al. </em>2011,<strong> </strong>FAO 2019a). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and there is a lack of younger people entering the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019a, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S.

In the East China Sea, heavy exploitation levels, small mesh sizes, and intensive fishing has caused declines in fish stocks, and a reduction in fish size and their trophic levels; the ‘fishing down’ effect from 1979 to 2014 is one of the highest estimated globally (Heileman and Tang 2009, Liang and Pauly 2017). Over 30% of the catch now consists of fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal (Cao <em>et al.</em> 2015, Liang and Pauly 2017). The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Since the 1990s in the South China Sea, more than 70% of the catch is of low-value fish and juvenile fish (Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/>  <p>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017).

The number of powered vessels operating in the EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (~350<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>500% increase) (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al. </em>2019, H.

Fisheries ramped up considerably in the Gulf of California in the 1980s  and 1990s, with an increase in the number of fishers, vessels, and nets  in the water; depletion of large pelagic sharks and other species occurred, and caused fishers to turn to coastal species (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004).

Centrophorus lesliei,"<p></p><p>Off East Africa, fishing effort is intense (Jacquet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Benkenstein 2013) and monitoring of artisanal and industrial fishing is difficult and reporting of catch landings is poor. Fishing effort is expanding into deeper waters and in some areas, shore-based artisanal fisheries using a number of gear types have the capacity to fish at depths where the species is likely to occur. Unidentified deep-water sharks, including <em>Centrophorus</em> spp, have been landed recently in Zanzibar Island, Tanzania (R. Bennett pers. comm. 21/02/20). All catch in these artisanal fisheries is likely to be utilized (R. Bennett pers. comm. 21/02/2020). There are a number of industrial demersal trawl fisheries, some dating back to 1968, which operate in the Southeast Indian Ocean and target a mixture of high-value crustaceans (deep-water prawns, lobsters, crabs) at depths of 300–700 m (Groeneveld and Everett 2015). Bycatch comprises a considerable amount of the catch, with sharks, fish, and cephalopods comprising ~85% of catch by weight (Doherty&#160;<em>et al. </em>2015). Fishing pressure in this region is expected to continue. For example, in 2017, the fishery in Madagascar intensified from 2 to 12 Chinese deep-water trawlers in 2017 without any known management measures (R. Bennett pers. comm. 25/5/2018). <br/><br/>Across West Africa, reported fish landings from distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950–2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1950–1998,&#160;there was an apparent increase in reported landings&#160;of deep-water sharks and dogfishes&#160;across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Gulper sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). Recently, targeted longline fisheries for <em>Centrophorus </em>spp and other deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016).&#160;In Mauritania, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from Black Hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;</p><p></p><br/><p></p>",Marine,Endangered,Centrophoridae
Cephaloscyllium fasciatum,"<p>The&#160;Reticulated Swellshark&#160;is subject to fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range. <br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive bottom trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon<em> et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter<em> et al</em>. 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante<em> et al</em>. 2013, FAO 2019, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s Exclusive Economic Zone significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics, pers. comm., 28/08/19, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics, pers. comm., 28/08/19). Bottom trawling operates to depths of 700 m, depending on the location. In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019). <br/><br/>In the Philippines, deepwater dogfish fisheries (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp and&#160;<em>Squalus&#160;</em>spp) date back to the 1960s (Flores 2004, BFAR 2017). These fisheries are poorly documented. In&#160;Cagayancillo, Palawan, Philippines, there are ~28 vessels in operation, setting demersal longlines to depths between 700–1,400 m (usually 800–1,000 m) (LAMAVE&#160;2017). These deepwater fisheries are known for their boom-and-bust nature, given the lack of management, and collapse over short periods of time (~10 years) before effort is shifted into new regions (Flores 2004). <br/><br/>Future development in the region, such as the&#160;'nine-dash line' area is claimed by China and&#160;the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, may enable increased fishing pressure&#160;and habitat degradation through dredging and land creation activities (Mora&#160;<em style="""">et al.</em>&#160;2016).</p>",Marine,Critically Endangered,Scyliorhinidae
Squalus formosus,"<p>This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. In Taiwan, and likely Japan, it is taken as bycatch by deep-water demersal trawl and longline and retained (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, deep-water trawl fisheries operate on the east coast, targeting multiple species of shrimp with all the incidental catch retained and marketed (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). The fishery, particularly operations out of Da-xi, has moved into deeper water over the past 30 years (from 1998 to 2019) due to depletion of shallow water shrimp species; from fishing depths of 100–300 m to depths of 300–700 m (D. Ebert unpubl. data 2019). During the monsoon season, conditions preclude deep-water trawling and some trawlers operate in the shallower depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019). Commercial deep-water longlines operate on the east coast of Taiwan, targeting mostly tuna with incidental catch of shark retained and marketed. The longline fishery likely began during the 1980s, and operates at depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho and H.

The demand for seafood has always been high and is suspected to continue to be high in Taiwan with per capita fish consumption similar to the high levels in China (Fabinyi and Liu 2014, Helgil 2019).

Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014, FAO 2020a). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020a). The demand for seafood is also high in Viet Nam, with per capita fish consumption steeply increasing over the last two decades to 36.3 kg per capita in 2017 (FAO 2020a, Helgil 2020a). <br/></p><p>  </p><p>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited.

The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p>  </p><p>In Malaysia, this species is regularly landed; it is captured as trawl bycatch in the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia and in gillnets during the monsoon season in Sarawak (A.

The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler <em>et al. </em>2002, A.

Demersal stocks captured by trawl gear have declined over the past five decades with some trawl stocks nearly eliminated (FAO 2020b). The commercial fleet operating in the Philippine’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1960s (2,100 vessels) to 2014 (6,400 vessels) and mostly use trawls, bagnets, purse seines, ringnets, longlines, and ‘baby trawlers’ of ~ 3GT (Palomares <em>et al. </em>2014). The small-scale fleet increased ten-fold from 1950 (~30,500 vessels) to the mid-1990s (~ 338,700 vessels) and while the fleet size has since remained relatively stable, the effort in terms of engine power has continued to rise, as has the number of subsistence vessels (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Across the Philippines, depending on the location, bottom trawls operate to a maximum depth of 200 m, and line fisheries operate to a maximum depth of 200–250 m (D. Tanay unpubl. data 2020).

Fishing effort across all sectors has been increasing since the 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s. Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009). Sharks and rays are an important resource and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al.</em> 2015).

In the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, intensive coastal development, that includes ongoing land reclamation, has led to widespread and significant loss of 35% of all intertidal habitat since the 1980s with 65% loss of one intertidal habitat, tidal flats, since the 1950s (Murray <em>et al.</em> 2014). In both the East and South China Seas, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years in the South China Sea, where there has also been modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman and Tang 2008, Heileman 2008). In Taiwan, there has been an estimated 10-20% loss of intertidal habitats in Taiwan since the 1970s (MacKinnon<em> et al.</em> 2012)</a>. In Viet Nam, dynamite and cyanide fishing, and sedimentation have caused widespread destruction of coral reefs (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995, FAO 2020a). Large areas of the coast are used for brackish-water aquaculture, which may have contributed to the dramatic loss of 45% of mangroves in Viet Nam from 1945 to 1995 (Jameson <em>et al.</em> 1995).",Marine,Near Threatened,Carcharhinidae
Lamiopsis tephrodes,"There is little information on catches of the Borneo Broadfin Shark as species-specific data are not usually recorded. The species is taken in a variety of gear including demersal trawls and inshore gillnets at locations influenced by river run-off, such as Mukah, Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo (Last <em>et al</em>. 2010). Shallow-water demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in Southeast Asia (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006), and this species is unlikely to have found any refuge as fishing effort in coastal waters and on the continental shelf has been extensive. Shark fishing (targeted or bycatch) is widespread, intensive, and generally unregulated across the region and practices are well known to be unsustainable (e.g., Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Dharmadi <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield by 32.8% in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Sharks are subject to intense fishing pressure on coastal and shelf habitats in Viet Nam. There is some targeting of sharks using longlines, hook and line, and ‘shark lines’. Target shark fisheries developed in the 1980s in response to demand for shark fin and other products including shark skin, cartilage, and liver oil and reached a peak at the end of the 1980s followed by a decline in catches (Lack and Sant 2012, V. Vo pers. comm. 14 May 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The industrial fleet began operating in Viet Nam’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the early 1970s but was very small until the mid-1980s when it expanded and then steadily increased to 53,000 vessels in 2014; there has been a steep rise in engine power over the past two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The fleet tends to operate in offshore fisheries (&gt;5 nautical miles (nm) from shore) and mostly use trawls, but also purse seine, longlines, and traps (FAO 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nm from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020).<br/><br/>Sharks are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). The number of fishers increased by 165% from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Indonesia has been the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years, with average landings reported to be over 100,000 t (Jaiteh <em>et al</em>. 2017) and worth an estimated $125 million USD in export (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018). Carcharhinids are commonly caught by bottom trawl and inshore demersal gillnet fisheries and commonly landed in local fish markets (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Carcharhinids are landed in 90% of fisheries operating in Indonesia (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018) and in some areas, over 50% of sharks landed are juveniles (Nawawi <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>Fisheries are an important sector in Malaysia, significantly contributing to the national economy, employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Ali unpubl. data 2020). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). In Malaysia, unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 1970s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). The number of vessels across all sectors has more tripled in Sarawak from 2,251 vessels in 1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). There has been, and still is, a currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian EEZ (Fowler et al. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption and are concentrated in the inshore waters and reefs, which has contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2009). The number of vessels across all sectors in Sarawak had more than doubled from 2,251 vessels in 1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In China, inshore coastal fisheries resources have been depleted since the 1980s, following intensive demersal trawling and stake net fisheries during the preceding thirty years (Yu and Yu 2008, Liang and Pauly 2017). The number of powered fishing vessels increased in China from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks across China has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al</em>. 2012). In response to fish stock depletions, the Chinese national government introduced measures in the 1980s and 1990s, that have since been modified, to reduce inshore fishing effort, including a ban on motorized trawling in close inshore waters, annual closed seasons, gear regulations such as a minimum mesh size, vessel buybacks, and fishing vessel scrapping (Yu and Yu 2008, Rueter <em>et al</em>. 2019). However, non-compliance with these measures is high, and fishing effort continues to increase, and in some areas, move offshore in response to declining inshore catches (Yu and Yu 2008, Villasante <em>et al</em>. 2013, FAO 2019, Pauly and Liang 2019). The demand for seafood in China is high and increasing, with China the largest consumers of seafood products globally; a 6 percent annual increase per capita fish consumption was evident from 1990 to 2010 (Fabinyi and Liu 2014).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near marine protected areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010). Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality include coastal habitat destruction and degradation with dramatic levels of habitat loss evident in the region (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006, White and Sommerville 2010). In the South China Sea, reclamation has contributed to a dramatic reduction in coastal and mangrove wetlands, with a loss of 70% of mangroves in the last 70 years, modification of up to 50% of seagrass beds, and degradation of significant areas of coral reef habitat (Heileman 2009). As this species predominantly occurs inshore, pollution from river outflow is also a possible threat.",Marine,Endangered,Carcharhinidae
Akheilos suwartanai,"<p>The effect of fishing activities, if any, on this species are unknown. The species may be taken incidentally in artisanal and small-scale industrial handline and demersal longline fisheries targeting groupers, snappers, and catfishes.&#160;There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across Indonesia, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in many areas across the Indo-West Pacific (Stobutzki<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2006).&#160;Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high, but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996).&#160;Indonesia has a considerable fishing fleet (~600,000 fishing vessels in marine waters) (KKP 2016). Despite a ban in 1980, demersal trawl fisheries still exist in Indonesia; small vessels (&lt;10&#160;Gross Tonnage) have modified their gear into ""mini trawls"" or&#160;<em>cakalang</em>/<em>cantrang&#160;</em>which target and retain demersal species at depths &lt;200 m (H. Booth pers. comm. 30/11/2019). Net and trawl fisheries in Indonesia (especially the Java Sea) and elsewhere are very extensive and as a result, many shark and ray species are highly exploited and stocks of most species have declined by at least an order of magnitude (Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009).&#160;</p>",Marine,Data Deficient,Scyliorhinidae

Hook mortality of Crocodile Sharks can be low (13%; Coelho <em>et al</em>. 2012). Some ecological risk assessments have ranked the Crocodile Shark as high risk due to their high susceptibility to capture and low biological productivity (e.g. AFMA 2014, Murua <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><strong><br/></strong>",Marine,Least Concern,Pseudocarchariidae
Sphyrna gilberti,"<p>The Carolina Hammerhead distribution in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic&#160;Ocean overlaps with that of the Scalloped Hammerhead and thus is likely exposed to similar threats, that is, it may be captured in longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and trawls (Camhi <em>et al</em>. 2008, Martinez-Ortiz <em>et al</em>. 2015, Rigby <em>et al. </em>2019). The species is likely retained for meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al. </em>2006a, Clarke&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006b, Fields <em>et al. </em>2018), unless regulations prohibit retention.

Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos,"<p>The Grey Reef Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small-scale&#160;longline, gillnet, trawl and handline fisheries that occur in the waters around coral reefs. There is little species specific information on catches. Most is taken as incidental catch in general reef fisheries targeting teleost fishes. However, it is occasionally taken in industrial scale fisheries. For example, Grey Reef Shark made up 4.2% (by number) of the sharks caught by the Papua New Guinea Shark Longline Fishery, making it the second most commonly caught species (White <em>et al</em>. 2020). The species is often retained for its meat, fins, and liver. The species is also taken in small amounts by recreational fishers in some countries.&#160;In Indonesia it makes up 0.1% of the elasmobranch catch landed at the port of Muncar (Winter <em>et al</em>. In press).&#160;While in Fiji, Grey Reef Shark makes up 6.3% (by number) of the sharks landed in small scale artisanal coastal fisheries (Glaus <em>et al</em>. 2015). In many parts of east Africa, and south and southeast Asian, there are large amounts of fishing effort targeted at carcharhinid sharks in continental shelf waters, and it continues to increase. For example, in the waters of Indonesia effort by small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017); and in Myanmar the International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, and the number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Only in locations where fisheries are strictly regulated (e.g. Australia) (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014), where human population densities are low (Nadon <em>et al</em>. 2009), or where dive-based tourism supports protection (Sutcliffe and Barnes 2018) are there low levels of threat that enable this species to remain common.&#160;</p><p>This is a common display species in public and private aquaria. It is exported live from countries such as Australia and Indonesia to aquaria worldwide.<br/></p><p>The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality.&#160;Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.</p><p>&#160;</p>",Marine,Endangered,Carcharhinidae
Carcharhinus amboinensis,"The Pigeye Shark is taken in coastal waters throughout its range as bycatch in industrial and small-scale fisheries by a variety of fishing gears, including gillnet, longline, trawl, and handline. Its large size makes it a frequently retained species due to the value of its fins and meat. The meat is prized in some markets and attracts a price premium. Data for the species is particularly sparse because of its similarity in appearance to the Bull Shark which has a similar size and an overlapping distribution. <br/><br/>In Australia, this species is caught in coastal gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries. For example, Harry et al. (2011) reported that it made up 1.3% of the gillnet catch (in numbers) in Queensland. It is taken in the North Prawn Fishery, with estimates of fishing mortality well below those that would lead to population decline (Zhou and Griffiths 2008). It is also captured in small amounts in the North Territory Offshore Net and Line Fishery, Northern Territory Barramundi Fishery, and Western Australia Kimberley Gillnet and Barramundi Fishery (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><br/>The species is caught throughout the coastal waters of Southeast Asia. However, in recent years its occurrence in landings has decreased in a number of nations. For example, Winter <em>et al</em>. (2020) did not report it in landings at Muncar in Indonesia in a 9-month period from 2017 to 2018. Similarly, in Thailand it has not been observed in recent surveys (Arunrugstichai et al. 2018). However, in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka it continues to occur in landings (Haque <em>et al</em>. 2019, D. Fernando unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas, the high level of exploitation on its habitat is of concern. For example, in Eritrea catch and effort data showed that total fishing effort as well as total annual catch increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002 (Tsehaye <em>et al</em>. 2007). While no accurate numbers are available, there has been an uncontrolled expansion of industrial trawling in the Red Sea through licences issued to foreign industrial trawlers (particularly off Yemen) which has resulted in the depletion of marine resources (PERSGA 2002). In Somalia, illegal and unregulated fishing by foreign trawlers and longliners is rife and impacting shark populations (Glaser <em>et al</em>. 2015). In India, there are over 13,400 gillnetters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number increased to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010) and all Indian states have high numbers of trawlers operating. In Pakistan, the Pigeye Shark was targeted in commercial fisheries along with the Bull Shark, but by 2001, these fisheries had ceased (M. Khan pers. comm. 14 January 2021)<br/><br/>The Pigeye Shark is taken in beach protection programs in Australia and South Africa that use drum-lines and gillnets; however, in some instances these programs release live sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Roff <em>et al</em>. 2018). This species’ presence in mangrove habitats means it is also threatened by extensive habitat degradation. Large coastal areas, in particular mangroves, have been lost in parts of its range. For e.g., across Indonesia from 1980 to 2005, the area of mangroves was reduced by &gt;30% through land conversion for urban development, shrimp farms, and agriculture (FAO 2007, Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Marine,Vulnerable,Carcharhinidae
Carcharhinus macloti,"The Hardnose Shark is caught as bycatch in industrial and small-scale fisheries by multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, trawl, hook and line, and longline. The species is generally retained for the meat and to a lesser extent, for the low value fins.<br/><br/>In the Western Indian Ocean, catches of marine resources reported to FAO have increased over the past 30 years but have levelled off since 1999, suggesting stocks are fully fished. Almost 3 million people are directly dependent on artisanal fishing for their livelihood along the shores of East Africa (van der Elst <em>et al</em>. 2005). Artisanal catches are under-reported and most small-scale, artisanal, and subsistence coastal fisheries within the Western Indian Ocean are considered to be fully- or over-exploited, especially where they are found close to population centres (FAO 2006).<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas region, there is high and increasing fishing pressure on the Hardnose Shark's inshore habitats. For example, in Iran, the number of fishers increased from 70,729–109,601 from 1993 to 2002 (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006), and in Gujarat state, India, the number of trawlers increased from 6,600–11,582 from the early 2000s to 2010 (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004, CMFRI 2010). Across Southeast Asia, historic and current fishing pressure is high and intensive. For example, in Indonesia, effort across all sectors has been increasing since the 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s. Indonesia has the highest global catch of sharks (Oakes and Sant 2019). Small-scale fisheries account for 90% of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). Sharks and rays are an important resource and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2020). The South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008).<br/><br/>In Australia, this species is a component of trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries across its range. On the east coast of Australia, the Hardnose Shark accounts for 4% of the elasmobranch catch within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area in the East Coast Inshore Finfish Fishery (Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011). It is also captured in small amounts in the Queensland Shark Control Program (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Marine,Near Threatened,Carcharhinidae
Carcharhinus sorrah,"There is little information on catches of the Spottail Shark as species-specific data is not usually recorded. Carcharhinids are susceptible to and caught in a variety of fishing gear types, particularly gillnets and longlines, as well as trawl nets (which generally capture smaller individuals and species). Fisheries throughout most of its distribution have experienced increased demand for sharks and simultaneously there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in many of these nations (e.g., Spaet and Berumen 2015). In Australia, the Spottail Shark is taken in coastal gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries in Queensland, Northern Territory, and Western Australia (Johnson <em>et al</em>. 2018). The levels of catch in these fisheries is currently modest and maintained at sustainable levels.<br/><br/>The Spottail Shark is reported to constitute 0.7% of the catch of sharks and rays at Muncar in eastern Java, Indonesia (Winter <em>et al</em>. 2020). Sharks are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). The number of fishers increased by 165% from 1951 to 1967, beginning the dramatic and ongoing increase in Indonesian fisheries production (Tull 2014). Small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Indonesia has been the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years, with average landings reported to be over 100,000 t (Jaiteh <em>et al</em>. 2017) and worth an estimated $125 million USD in export (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018). Carcharhinids are commonly caught by bottom trawl and inshore demersal gillnet fisheries and commonly landed in local fish markets (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Carcharhinids are landed in 90% of fisheries operating in Indonesia (Booth <em>et al</em>. 2018) and in some areas, over 50% of sharks landed are juveniles (Fahmi and Sumadhiharga 2007, Fahmi <em>et al</em>. 2013, Nawawi et al. 2020, Winter <em>et al</em>. 2020, ).<br/><br/>Fisheries are an important sector in Malaysia, significantly contributing to the national economy, employment opportunities, and protein supply (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Spottail Sharks are taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries using multiple fishing gears including trawl, seine net, longline, gillnet, and set net. All bycatch in Malaysia is retained for the meat for human consumption, for bait in traps or for fish meal production for aquaculture. Unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s meant that inshore fisheries were fully exploited by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has more than doubled from 22,800 vessels in 1950 to 50,150 vessels in 2014. However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors in Sarawak has more than doubled from 2,251 vessels in 1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2010 (Teh and Teh 2014). However, the substantial increase over this period has been in engine power, which has dramatically increased by ~30 fold (Pauly et al. 2020). There has been, and is still, currently rising trend in fish consumption throughout the country and ~85% of this comes from within the Malaysian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Fowler <em>et al</em>. 2002, A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). Small-scale fisheries provide the main supply for local consumption and are concentrated to the inshore waters and reefs, which has contributed significantly to habitat destruction and reduced abundances of all commercially important fishes in the area (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2009). Reporting to FAO for sharks and rays comprises ~3% of global catch at 23,808 t per year through 2000–2010. Purse seine and gillnets contribute to the majority of the landings. Fisheries operating within 30 nautical miles (nm) from the coast contribute 85% to the total marine fish landings with vessels &lt;70 Gross Tonnage (GT). In waters beyond 30 nm from the coast, trawls, and purse seines are the main fishing gears, deployed form large vessels &gt;70 GT. <br/><br/>Spottail Sharks is subject to intense fishing pressure on its coastal habitats in Viet Nam being taken as bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple gears that include trawl, purse seine, gillnet, and longline, and it is retained for human consumption or for fish meal production (FAO 2020). There is some targeting of sharks using longlines, hook and line, and ‘shark lines’. Target shark fisheries developed in the 1980s in response to demand for shark fin and other products including shark skin, cartilage, and liver oil and reached a peak at the end of the 1980s followed by a decline in catches (Lack and Sant 2012, V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020). The motorized fishing fleet has been increasing since the 1950s and rapidly expanded in the mid-1980s to 2000s when Viet Nam moved towards a market-oriented economy (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The industrial fleet began operating in Viet Nam’s EEZ in the early 1970s, but was very small until the mid-1980s when it expanded and then steadily increased to 53,000 vessels in 2014; there has been a steep rise in engine power over the past two decades (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The fleet tends to operate in offshore fisheries (&gt;5 nm from shore) and mostly use trawls, but also purse seine, longlines, and traps (FAO 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly et al. 2020). This fleet tends to operate in inshore waters at depths less than 50 m, and within 4–5 nautical miles from shore, and mostly use small trawl, gillnet, longline, lift-net, push net, and traps (Teh <em>et al</em>. 2014, FAO 2020). <br/><br/>Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal, and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). The current fishing effort on demersal marine fish stocks is 33% greater than Maximum Sustainable Yield by 32.8% in the Gulf of Thailand, based on recent stock assessments and catch-per-unit effort is declining for the majority of fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand (DoF 2015, Derrick <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Sharks are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters prior to a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004, large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004, sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al</em>. 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale, and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners, and longliners. International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated&#160; the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.<br/><br/>In Kuwait, in 2008, the Spottail Shark made up 12% of elasmobranch landings by number while in Qatar it represented 4% of elasmobranch landings by number (Moore <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2012). In Bahrain, it represented 7% of elasmobranch landings by number (Moore and Peirce 2013). In a survey of landing sites along the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden coasts, this species was reported from Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Egypt and accounted for 7% of shark landings by number (Bonfil 2003). In Yemen, it was one of the dominant species landed around Socotra Islands and in the Gulf of Aden (up to 12% of shark landings by number) (Shaher 2007). In Sudan, it made up 19% of the shark landings by number in 2002 and 11% in 2013–2014 (I. Elhassan unpubl. data 2017). It is also commonly caught by illegal Yemeni fishers operating in Sudanese waters (16% of landings by number during three days of fishing). In the Saudi Red Sea, it makes up 33% of elasmobranch landings by number, with many of those landed being juveniles targeted in nursery areas (Spaet and Berumen 2015). This species is not very common in the Maldives, although it was caught on handlines prior to the ban on shark fisheries (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Ali 2015). In Sri Lanka, it is also one of the dominant species in landings (IOTC 2014).<br/><br/>In the Red Sea, the number of traditional boats operating more than tripled from about 3,100 to 10,000 between 1988 and 2006 (Bruckner <em>et al</em>. 2011). The high level of exploitation on its habitat is of concern. For example, in Eritrea catch and effort data showed that total fishing effort as well as total annual catch increased more than two-fold from 1996 to 2002 (Tsehaye <em>et al</em>. 2007). While no accurate numbers are available, there has been an uncontrolled expansion of industrial trawling in the Red Sea through licenses issued to foreign industrial trawlers (particularly off Yemen) which has resulted in the depletion of marine resources (PERSGA 2002).

Furthermore, there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004).

In Australia, the Sliteye Shark was one of the most commonly captured sharks captured by demersal trawls (Last and Stevens 2009), however spatial and temporal fishery closures have since occurred. The species is now caught in low numbers in gillnet fisheries in Western Australia, Northern Territory, and Queensland (e.g. Harry <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gutteridge 2012).<br/><br/>This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change.

It is retained for the meat and fins where possible. There is little data available on the capture of this species in fisheries of island nations in the Pacific Ocean where the species show little trend in population size. Throughout the coastal waters of Asia, it is caught in gillnets, longlines, trawls and handlines and landed. However, in recent years it has rarely been reported in surveys of landings sites. For example, Winter <em>et al</em>. (2020) reported a single individual in landings at Muncar in Indonesia in a 9 month period in 2017–2018. Similar levels of paucity of catch are reported in Thailand (Arunrugstichai <em>et al</em>. 2018), Philippines (Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources 2017) and Sri Lanka (Dissanayake 2005). In the Arabian Seas region, there is little species-specific data on&#160;Sharptooth Lemon Shark catch but generally, carcharhinids there are susceptible to and caught in a variety of fishing gear types, particularly gillnets and longlines, as well as trawl nets (which generally capture smaller individuals and species). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Bonfil 2003, Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2007, Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches (e.g., De Silva 2006, Spaet and Berumen 2015). For example, in the Red Sea, the number of traditional boats operating more than tripled from about 3,100 to 10,000 between 1988 and 2006 (Bruckner <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;<br/><br/>In Australia, this species is caught in coastal gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries in northern waters. For example, Harry <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported that it made up 0.3% of the gillnet catch (in numbers) in Queensland. It is&#160; taken in the North Prawn Fishery, with estimates of fishing mortality below those that would lead to population decline (Zhou and Griffiths 2008). It is also captured in small amounts in the North Territory Offshore Net and Line Fishery, Northern Territory Barramundi Fishery, and Western Australia Kimberley Gillnet and Barramundi Fishery (Simpfendorfer <em>et al</em>. 2019). The Sharptooth Lemon Shark was identified as a minor component of the large and prevalent Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing (IUU) in northern Australian waters during the early 2000s (Field <em>et al</em>. 2009, Marshall 2011). However, the IUU fishing has declined significantly since 2006 due to increased border surveillance, international agreements, and possibly increased fuel prices and reduction in target shark species (Field <em>et al</em>. 2009, Haward and Bergin 2016).<br/><br/>The reliance of the Sharptooth Lemon Shark on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report, 2019). Destructive fishing practices in some nations (e.g. dynamite fishing) (McManus 1997) and declining water quality (MacNeil <em>et al</em>. 2019) have also led to the decline in coral reef habitat.<br/><br/>The reliance of this species on mangrove habitats, especially as pupping and nursery grounds makes them susceptible to declines in habitat quality. The extent of mangrove habitat has declined markedly, with 20-35% of areas lost during the last half of the 20th century (Polidoro <em>et al</em>. 2010) as a result of coastal development for urbanisation, aquaculture and agriculture, timber harvesting sand resource extraction (Goldberg <em>et al</em>. 2020).",Marine,Endangered,Carcharhinidae
Rhizoprionodon oligolinx,"<p>  </p>The Grey Sharpnose Shark is targeted and caught incidentally in industrial and small-scale fisheries by multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, hook and line, and longline. The species is generally retained for the meat and to a lesser extent, for the low value fins. In the Arabian Seas region, there is high and increasing fishing pressure on the Grey Sharpnose Shark's inshore habitats. For example, in Iran, the number of fishers increased from 70,729–109,601 from 1993 to 2002 (Valinassab <em>et al</em>. 2006), and in Gujarat state, India, the number of trawlers increased from 6,600–11,582 from the early 2000s to 2010 (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004, CMFRI 2010). Across Southeast Asia, historic and current fishing pressure is high and intensive. For example, in Indonesia, effort across all sectors has been increasing since the 1950s with steep increases in effort since the 1980s. Indonesia has the highest global catch of sharks (Oakes and Sant 2019). Small-scale fisheries account for 90% of fisheries production in Indonesia (Tull 2014). Sharks and rays are an important resource and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2020). The South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore, and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing.<br/><p></p>",Marine,Near Threatened,Carcharhinidae
Triaenodon obesus,"<p>The Whitetip Reef Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small-scale&#160;longline, gillnet, trawl and handline fisheries that occur in the waters around coral reefs. Most is taken as incidental catch in general reef fisheries targeting teleost fishes. The species is often retained for its meat, fins, and liver. The species is also taken in small amounts by recreational fishers in some countries. In many parts of east Africa, and south and east Asian, there are large amounts of fishing effort targeted at carcharhinid sharks in continental shelf waters, and it continues to increase. For example, in the waters of Indonesia effort by small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population into account (Ramenzoni 2017); and in Myanmar the International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, and the number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Only in locations where fisheries are strictly regulated (e.g. Australia) (Espinoza <em>et al</em>. 2014), where human population densities are low (Nadon <em>et al.</em> 2009), or where dive-based tourism supports protection (Sutcliffe and Barnes 2018) are there low levels of threat that enable this species to remain common.</p><p>The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality.&#160;Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997.

Nebrius ferrugineus,"The Tawny Nurse Shark is caught throughout its range in industrial and small-scale longline, gillnet, trawl, and handline fisheries that occur in the waters around coral reefs and other complex habitats. There is little species-specific information on catches, and the magnitude of catches is poorly understood, especially in those areas where population reductions have been the greatest. The species is rarely targeted, except for use as an aquarium display species, because its meat and fins are considered of low value. It is often discarded, but is retained in some nations, including India, Indonesia, Philippines, and Sri Lanka. In recent years, it has only been rarely observed at fish landing sites in Indonesia where it is caught mostly by demersal longline and coastal gillnet vessels. For example, Winter <em>et al.</em> (2020) reporting it made up 0.1% of the elasmobranch catch landed at the port of Muncar in 2017–2018. In the Andaman Islands (India) it is caught mostly in the grouper demersal longline fishery, but also occasionally in trawls. In India, this species is caught in line and gillnet fisheries with landings ranged between from 1 to 84 t per year on the west coast for 2010–2015 (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). In Sri Lanka, this species is caught incidentally, and the meat is considered to be of low quality and value. This is a common display species in public and private aquaria. It is exported live from countries such as Australia and Indonesia to aquaria worldwide, but this trade is small compared to catches in fisheries.<br/><br/>The reliance of this species on coral reefs makes it susceptible to declines in habitat quality. Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report, 2019).

Iago omanensis,"This species is taken in industrial and artisanal trawl fisheries in India (Barnes et al. 2018). In the main part of the Red Sea, shrimp trawlers usually take this species as retained and marketed bycatch (Baranes 2007). In the Red Sea, small-scale fishing boats are commonly used but, in some areas, larger vessels with long-range capabilities also take part in the fishery. Across the surveyed areas of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, the Bigeye Houndshark represented 3% of recorded shark landings by number (Bonfil 2003). This is a commercial species captured by Jordanian artisanal fishers; however, the fleet was small with only 100 vessels (Baranes 2005). It is taken by mostly artisanal hook and line fisheries in the Gulf of Aqaba, Eilat (Baranes 2007). In the Gulf of Aqaba, the species is also taken by handline, gillnet, and benthic traps and there are concerns about the declines in catch levels in the Gulf of Aqaba where mainly female sharks are taken in the shallow waters (Baranes 2007). This species segregates by sex with depth, the females occupying a shallower depth range (~300 m depth) than the males and as such, adult females in the population are more vulnerable to capture in fisheries (Baranes 2007). Off Oman, this species is caught as bycatch by longline fisheries, but these fisheries are mainly distributed outside the species range (Henderson et al. 2006). Juveniles of this species are not susceptible to capture in Oman's artisanal fisheries (Henderson <em>et al</em>. 2009). It is caught occasionally by fisheries in Yemen, mostly close to the border with Oman (Hadramout Province) (I. Elhassan pers. comm. 5 February 2017).<br/><br/>Off India and Pakistan, the high level of exploitation within the species' habitat and the increasing deep-water fisheries are of concern, including targeted deep-water shark fisheries. For example, in India, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear also deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore, there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al</em>. 2004). This number almost doubled to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010). In Pakistan waters, about 2,000 trawlers operate in shelf waters, targeting shrimp in shallow waters and fish in deeper shelf waters (M. Khan pers. comm. 6 February 2017).",Marine,Least Concern,Triakidae
Proscyllium magnificum,"In Myanmar, the Magnificent Catshark is caught in demersal trawl at depths &lt;100 m and by longlines at depths of 70–200 m, although longline captures are rare (A. Maung unpubl. data 2020). In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, it has been caught in deep-water trawls targeting shrimp (<em>Plesionika </em>spp. and <em>Heterocarpus </em>spp.) at depths of 300 m off South Sentinel Island (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2015). This species is likely either a discarded bycatch or is retained as a 'trash' fish for animal feed mills in Myanmar, but was landed for sale in the Andaman Islands (Kumar <em>et al</em>. 2015). Post-release survival rate is unknown.<br/><br/>More generally, sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. The inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale and include many subsistence level fishers. At times since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners, and longliners. The International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014. <br/><br/>In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, this is one of the small uncommon sharks caught as bycatch in longline fisheries at depths of 80–300 m (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). Very few individuals, less than ten, were encountered during surveys from 2016 to 2019 (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020). This species may also have been captured in an artisanal deep-water vertical handline fisheries targeting the deepwater gulper and dogfish sharks (<em>Centrophorus </em>spp. and <em>Squalus </em>spp.) for their liver oil. This deep-water fishery operated intermittently between 1988–1992 and used 300–450 hooks per vessels at depths of 200–400 m (Soundrararajan and Roy 2004). Intensive longline and handline fishing pressure targeting groupers and snappers at depths of 50–150 m may catch higher numbers of individuals than the fisheries targeting deep-water sharks (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,Near Threatened,Proscylliidae
Hemitriakis indroyonoi,"The Indonesian Houndshark is caught as bycatch in demersal longline and demersal gillnets which operate both inshore and in deepwater areas (White <em>et al. </em>2006, Dharmadi unpubl. data 2020). This species is especially susceptible to heavy fishing pressure as its current known area of occupancy (AOO) is limited to ~72 km² and this does not include any refuge areas (CTI 2020). The Indonesian distribution occurs between two heavily populated cities, making it easily accessible to fishers. From March 2010 to January 2011, only 114 individuals were found, despite market surveys looking for this species (Faizah <em>et al.</em> 2012). Many of these individuals were juveniles, indicating the possibility of recruitment overfishing occurring for this species. In a later survey of artisanal fishers in Lombok in January-December 2016 and April and July 2017, 454 individuals were observed with most of the individuals also juveniles (Sentosa and Chodrijah 2020) and the first estimation of growth indicating the species likely has a slow growth rate (Sentosa and Chodrijah 2020). In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most  (~90%) of  fisheries  production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by  these  small-scale  fisheries has tripled when taking population growth  into  account  (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important  resource in  Indonesia  and are the main livelihood for some communities  (Sadili <em>et al</em>.   2015). Fishing pressure in Indonesia is intense  with the largest   chondrichthyan fishery globally and the country has  been among the top  shark  fishing nations for over 20 years (Oakes and  Sant 2019).<br/><br/>In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands there are currently 2,784 fishing vessels active including 7,034 licensed fishers (Tyabji <em>et al.</em> 2020). These vessels target sharks and rays using pelagic and deep-water longlines. Additionally, sharks are caught as bycatch by longlines, trawlers, gillnets, and hook and line (Tyabji&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Near Campbell Bay on Great Nicobar Island, where this species occurs, there are ~20 commercial vessels in operation in addition to artisanal fishers, thus, this area may provide some refuge from fishing pressure (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).",Marine,Endangered,Triakidae
Orectolobus leptolineatus,"This species is captured as bycatch of trawl and possibly gillnet fisheries and retained. Four specimens caught by trawl were landed in Kota Kinabalu, Sarawak (A. Bin Ali unpubl. data 2020). In Indonesia, most fisheries in Lombok fish deeper than 60 m, but this species is caught by very small boats and usually caught together with rays, and typically fishing at &lt; 60 m deep (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). This species is regularly landed in Lombok with several individuals landed each month (Fahmi unpubl. data 2020). In Indonesia, small-scale fisheries comprise most (~90%) of fisheries production (Tull 2014). In some regions, effort by these small-scale fisheries has tripled when taking population growth into account (Ramenzoni 2017). Sharks and rays are an important resource in Indonesia and are the main livelihood for some communities (Sadili <em>et al</em>. 2015). Fishing pressure in Indonesia is intense with the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally, and substantial catches of target and bycatch chondrichthyans (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Indonesia has been among the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years (Oakes and Sant 2019) and the catch of rays is rising as shark fisheries collapse.

Squatina californica,"Historically, the Pacific Angel Shark was discarded at sea or used as bait, but in the 1970s a commercial fishery in California began targeting this species. A rapid increase in Pacific Angel Shark landings between 1983-1986 occurred in California (Richards 1987), leading to concern that stocks could be overexploited. Even though a minimum size was proposed for the gillnet fishery targeting both California Halibut (<em>Paralichthys californicus</em>) and Pacific Angel Shark, this measure proved not to be effective at reversing the declining population levels along the Santa Barbara/Ventura coast and Channel Islands areas, California (Richards 1987, Cailliet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1993). Additionally, it was observed that declines in landings were occurring prior to the implementation of these management strategies indicating the over-exploitation of the species within the region (Leet <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>In Mexico this species is caught in fisheries targeting elasmobranchs. Fishing effort in Mexico is challenging to quantify, as some fishers hold licenses but are inactive, while others may share a single license among multiple vessels (Sosa-Nishizaki, pers. comm. 2016). This species is now absent from regions in Baja California Sur where it was historically found in catches (Laguna San Ignacio and Bahia Magdalena), and there is also evidence for depensation in this region (Ramirez-Amaro&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).",Marine,Near Threatened,Squatinidae
Squalus blainville,"The Longnose Spurdog is taken as incidental catch in demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries (Maroungiu <em>et al</em>. 2020). Spurdogs may be reported under a generic code (<em>Squalus</em> spp.) due to taxonomic uncertainties (e.g. Peristeraki <em>et al</em>. 2020). Along the eastern Atlantic and in the Mediterranean Sea, the species is often confused with the Shortnose Spurdog (<em>Squalus megalops</em>) and Spiny Dogfish (<em>Squalus acanthias</em>) (Veríssimo <em>et al</em>. 2017, ICES-WGEF 2019).<br/><br/>Both the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean have been subject to extensive and intensive deep-water fishing across much of the species' known depth and spatial range. Historically, spurdogs (primarily the Spiny Dogfish, <em>Squalus acanthias</em>) have been intensively fished off Europe since the early 1900s (Bonfil 1994). In the Mediterranean, most targeted fishing for the Spiny Dogfish ceased in the 1970s with declines in stocks; however, unregulated and incidental capture still occurs in the Mediterranean and Black Seas (e.g. Ţoţoiu <em>et al</em>. 2016, Bonanomi <em>et al</em>. 2018). Catches are fully commercialized (Serena <em>et al</em>. 2009, Farrugio and Soldo 2013).<br/><br/>Across West Africa, the Longnose Spurdog was frequently reported from Mauritania to Guinea (Diop and Dossa, 2011). There are currently three active mixed fishery bilateral agreements between the European Union and the West African nations of Morocco, Mauritania, and Guinea-Bissau (European Commission 2020). These agreements, known as Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements (SFPAs) involve payments to third party countries in exchange for access to marine resources and sectorial support aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries development in the partner countries. Under SFPAs, there are a number of European distant-water industrial vessels using demersal trawls to capture deep-water shrimps at depths of 150–850 m in Guinea-Bissau (Sobrino <em>et al</em>. 2017) and at depths of 400–950 m in Mauritania (Fernandez Peralta <em>et al</em>. 2019). In Mauritania, demersal trawl fisheries for black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis </em>and <em>Merluccius polli</em>) operate mainly at depths of 500–700 m (Fernandez Peralta et al. 2019). In the Mauritanian trawl fisheries, unidentified deep-water sharks and rays have accounted for approximately 10% of landings (Fernandez Peralta <em>et al</em>. 2019). Demersal trawl and longline fisheries in southern Morocco target a number of demersal fish, including black hake and scabbardfish (<em>Aphanopus </em>spp.). Trawl fishing there occurs mostly at depths of 500–800 m and longline fishing occurs at depths of 100–400 m (Cervantes <em>et al</em>. 2018). Further information on bycatch species in these fisheries is largely unknown. Off South Africa, <em>Squalus </em>species are often recorded only to the genus level (Squalus spp.) and have been reported in inshore and offshore demersal trawl, demersal longline (including those targeting sharks), beach-seine and gillnet fisheries, with estimated average annual catches of up to 100 t between 2010–2012 (da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>There are also an estimated 518 Chinese distant-water vessels registered in Africa; most (480) vessels fly flags from West Africa between Morocco and Gabon and most (426) are trawlers (Gutiérrez <em>et al</em>. 2020). Fishing effort is widespread, often takes place in deep offshore areas, and some “high intensity” areas have been identified off Guinea to Sierra Leone and off the Congo (Gutiérrez et al. 2020). Virtually nothing is known about these fishing activities. West Africa has some of the highest levels of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the world, and IUU fishing by large industrial trawlers has contributed to depleted fish stocks across the region (Daniels <em>et al</em>. 2016). Of the stocks assessed in the Eastern Central Atlantic, most are either overexploited or are fully exploited and are fished at levels that are not sustainable in the short term (FAO 2020).",Marine,Data Deficient,Squalidae
Somniosus cheni,"The Taiwan Sleeper Shark was caught in a small, localized&#160;deep-water demersal longline fishery operating at depths of 500–1,000 m (Wang and Yang 2004, Hsu&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). The fishery previously targeted aggregating sleeper sharks, including Pacific Sleeper Shark (<em>Somniosus pacificus</em>), as well as sixgill sharks (<em>Hexanchus </em>spp.) (Wang and Yang 2004). It is unclear if the fishery still targets sleeper sharks. Historically, the fishery included three small (&lt; 20 t and &lt; 10 m long) coastal fishing boats&#160;operating from February to June, and daily catches included up to three sleeper sharks (Wang and Yang 2004).<br/><br/>Fisheries in Taiwan have been intense. By the 1950s, the coastal fisheries of Taiwan were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone and distant waters (Kuo and Booth 2011). Other deep-water sharks that were once relatively common in Taiwan in the late 1980s, were considered rare by the 2000s, and have not been observed in the past 10 years (Rigby&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). Sleeper sharks generally have low productive life histories, making them susceptible to population reduction from fisheries exploitation (e.g., Kulka&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2020). Given the high levels of regional fishing activity and reported local depletion of deep-water sharks, monitoring of the targeted sleeper shark fishery, as well as landing site catches is highly recommended.",Marine,Data Deficient,Somniosidae
Squalus boretzi,"The species may be taken as bycatch in demersal and pelagic trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries on the Emperor Seamounts. The type specimens were captured in 1979, 2009, and 2010 by demersal and mid-water research trawl (Dolganov 2019). Commercial catches of this species are unknown, and it is unknown if it is retained or discarded. The fisheries in the region have operated since 1967 and fished heavily during the 1960s to 1980s mostly at depths of 300–600 m (Baco <em>et al</em>. 2019). The fisheries currently operate mostly in the Southern Emperor seamounts, which encompass the known range of this species and mostly operate at depths of 300–500 m. However, some Japanese gillnets may operate at depths of 300–1,300 m and an exploratory South Korea longliner operated at depths of 250–1,050 m in the mid-2000s (CHM 2016, Shotton 2016, NPFC 2020). The demersal trawl fisheries mainly target North Pacific Armourhead (<em>Pentaceros wheeleri</em>) that do not occur below depths of 800 m and Splendid Alfosino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) that occurs at depths of 25–1,300 m (Froese and Pauly 2019, NPFC 2020).",Marine,Near Threatened,Squalidae
Mustelus mento,"<p>This houndshark is captured mainly by artisanal gillnet fisheries and occasional landings from industrial trawl fisheries, particularly in Chile. Peruvian catches of this species are probably small compared to those for the Humpback Smoothhound (<em>M. whitneyi</em>) because the abundance of the Speckled Smoothound increases towards southern Peru. The bulk of this species' distribution occurs in northern Chile. The highest catches of tollo are taken in the south, mainly by coastal artisanal gillnet fisheries with occasional landings to this category from industrial vessels (Lamilla <em>et al.</em> 2005a, Lamilla&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005b; J. Lamilla unpubl. data). However, inferring population trajectory from the bulk of these unsorted landings in Chile is challenging, both because of the reduction in effort and the mixed species composition of this product (which varies with latitude).<br/><br/>First, tollo landings in Chile peaked at about 1,300 t in 1989 and have since declined steadily to 200 t or less since 1995. However, this decline in landings may not be indicative of a steep population decline as effort in the tollo gillnet fishery may have increased during the late 1980s because of transfer of effort from the hake fishery, which then declined during the early 1990s as effort shifted to the ray fishery (E. Acuña pers. comm. 2006).<br/><br/>Second, in Chile, occasional large artisanal landings attributed to this species may be composed of the other shark species, including Spiny Dogfish (<em>Squalus acanthias</em>) and Tope (<em>Galeorhinus galeus</em>). Catches of Spiny Dogfish taken in the artisanal fisheries in the south (41 degrees) are driving peaks in the landings of tollo. Taken together, the fluctuations in these landings are largely explained by variation in fishing effort, and the dominance of landings by Spiny Dogfish and Tope mean that these do not provide a good index of population size in Chile. However, there are species-specific landings data that suggest a 98% decline in landings since the peak in 1979 (C. Bustamante unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>Overall, this houndshark is exposed to multiple inadequately managed fisheries, it has no refuge at depth, there has been a steep decline in landings since 1979, and fisheries pressure is increasing. <br/></p>",Marine,Critically Endangered,Triakidae

This species is the fourth most commonly-caught shark in artisanal longlines and gillnets (O. Lasso unpubl. data 2019). Groundfish fisheries on the Brazil-Guianas shelf were already fully over-exploited by 2000; these fisheries are multi-gear, multi-species, and multinational, with vessels crossing national maritime borders (Booth <em>et al. </em><span class=""text"">2001). Despite some areal closures and the implementation of a total allowable catch of target species, there is now a diminished effort and number of vessels in operation there (Diop <em>et al.</em><span class=""text""> 2015).

In Uruguay, the industrial demersal trawl fleet was developed in the late 1970s, and many target stocks were overexploited by the 1990s (Defeo <em>et al.</em><span class=""text""> 2011).</span></span></p><p>Third, in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, gillnets that often target sharks have been operating since at least mid-century in the Gulf of California, and have led to declines in pelagic sharks and other marine life (Sala <em>et al. </em>2004). Artisanal fisheries targeting sharks including this species have been operating around Mazatlan since at least the 1960s (Kato 1965). Later research has revealed that this species is no longer present in the Gulf of California and that very few records have come from the southern portion of Mexico (Pérez-Jiménez 2014). Further south in this portion of the species' range, heavy artisanal fishing pressure exists with little management in place, and there are unmanaged commercial longline and trawl fisheries off parts of western Central and South America.<span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""> This  species may also suffer from&#160;habitat loss due to coastal development  and the conversion of mangrove forest to shrimp aquaculture is  detrimental to this species.<br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><br/><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text surname""><span class=""text""></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p></span>",Marine,Endangered,Sphyrnidae
Carcharhinus falciformis,"The Silky Shark is the second most caught species of shark globally, after the Blue Shark (<em>Prionace glauca</em>) (Oliver <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Silky Shark is both targeted or caught as incidental (bycatch) by longline fisheries and purse seine fisheries (especially those using drifting fish aggregating devices [FADs]) as well as by artisanal fisheries. FADs are made of a floating object and nets that lie vertical in the water column to attract schools of fish. The Silky Shark, as well as other species, is easily entangled in the nets; and there have been large increases in the use of FADs since 1996 (Leroy <em>et al</em>. 2013). Whether they are targeted or an incidental catch, the Silky Shark is often either retained for its meat and fins where regulations allow, or released with high mortality rates apparent in the tropical purse seine fisheries (Hutchinson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Total catches of the Silky Shark reported to FAO are mainly from Sri Lanka (Western Indian Ocean) with the FAO catch less than 4,000 tonnes (t) from 2005-2009 before doubling in 2010 and 2011. Catches then decreased to ~5,000 t in 2012 and 2013 (FAO 2015).<br/><br/>The Silky Shark was found to represent at least 3-4% of the fins auctioned in Hong Kong, the world's largest shark fin trading centre—the third highest after Blue Shark and Hammerhead Shark (general) (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2006a)—and Hong Kong is thought to make up more than half of the global shark fin trade (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2006b). Silky Shark fins are valuable to the trade, although they are not one of the highest value fin types (S. Clarke, unpubl. data).<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>The Silky Shark is taken in pelagic commercial fisheries in the eastern central and southeast Pacific, as well as in coastal artisanal fisheries of the region. Fishing pressure from longline and purse seine fisheries targeting tunas and swordfish is high, and it is the main shark species caught in fisheries using FADs as well as longline fisheries in the eastern Pacific (Oliver <em>et al</em>. 2015). In addition to mortality, FADs may be influencing behaviour of the Silky Shark. In the eastern Pacific, Silky Shark diet contained high proportions of FAD-associated prey items, probably due to the increasing likelihood of an encounter with prey items at FADs (Duffy <em>et al</em>. 2015). If this behaviour continues, Silky Shark may be increasingly attracted to FADs and fishing mortality may be increased.<br/><br/>Mexico contributed the most to catch of the Silky Shark in the north and southeast Pacific, catching up to 40% of the total catch (12-16,000 t in the north and 11-16,000 t in the south per year) (IATTC 2013). The IATTC observer database from 1993-2005 showed that the Silky Shark was caught throughout the ocean west of central America, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru out to about 170°W on purse seines set on FADs. The Silky Shark was the most commonly caught species of shark in the purse seine fishery for tunas in the eastern Pacific Ocean (IATTC 2007). The fishery has largely increased the use of FADs, which the Silky Shark is attracted to, increasing the catch rate of the Silky Shark in the fishery (Aires da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014). Additionally, it is mainly juveniles caught North of the equator and caught in FAD sets.<br/><br/>Reported catches of the Silky Shark are approximately four times higher north of the equator in the purse seine fleets (IATTC 2013). In the north, 30-45,000 individuals were caught each year (2006-2010), while in the south, &lt;10,000 individuals were caught each year (IATTC 2013). In the longline sector of the IATTC, annual catches of the Silky Shark ranged from 20-60,000 individuals in the north to 10-30,000 individuals in the south. Catches of the Silky Shark in waters around Mexico have been steadily increasing from the late 1970s, when over 3,000 t were caught to the 2000s, when 6-7,000 t of Silky Shark was caught (IATTC 2013). Central American unreported catch was estimated to be similar to the catch in Mexico of 6-7,000 sharks in recent years (IATTC 2013).<br/><br/>The Silky Shark are a major component of the shark catch in many fisheries along the Pacific coast of Central America. Observations made on a longline research vessel that sampled waters in the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of Panama, El Salvador, and Guatemala found that Silky Shark constituted 31%, 47% and 29% of the total catch respectively, and 80%, 63% and 44% of the shark catch respectively (Porras 1996). Off Chiapas, southern Mexico, Silky Shark (along with Scalloped Hammerhead, <em>Sphyrna lewini</em>) form the large bulk of the shark catch (Soriano-Velásquez and Acal Sánchez 2008). In Tres Marías Islands, Mexico, Silky Shark is a major part of the catch constituting 27% of landed sharks in 1996 (Pérez-Jiménez <em>et al</em>. 2005). In San José and Buena Vista, Guatemala, Silky Shark constituted 73% of recorded catches landed, in a sample of 4,211 sharks, from 1996 to 1999 (Ruiz and Ixquiac 2000).<br/><br/>International longline vessels operating in the eastern central Pacific landed and exported over 8,000 t of shark carcasses and 900 t of shark fins from Costa Rica in 2002 (Costa Rica official INCOPESCA Fishery Statistics 2003), the large majority of which were recorded as the Silky Shark. However, these figures must be interpreted with caution as other sharks may have been misidentified as the Silky Shark. International vessels are known to transship shark products on the high seas, meaning these shipments are unreported. In 1991 in Costa Rica, sharks formed 27% of the total catch (Arauz <em>et al</em>. 2004). In 2000, only 8% of the total catch was sharks, 71% of which were Silky Shark. In 2003, the proportion of sharks in the total catch decreased further to 5% of the total catch, the Silky Shark made up 58% of the shark catch (Arauz <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the Costa Rican longline fishery, most of the Silky Shark catch is composed of juveniles. Since 2004, adults made up less than 15% of the Silky Shark catch (Dapp <em>et al</em>. 2013). Additionally, the total length of individuals caught decreased significantly from 2004 and 2007 to 2008-2010, indicating a decrease in spawning stock biomass (Dapp <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In Manta (the largest fishing port in Ecuador), artisanal fisheries data from September 2003 to the end of 2006 showed over 22,000 Silky Shark were caught (J. Martínez pers. comm. Feb. 2007). From 2008-2012, over 137, 000 individuals were caught throughout Ecuador which is six times the amount of the previous four years (Martínez-Ortiz <em>et al</em>. 2015). The landed females ranged in length from 61-309 cm TL, and the males ranged in length from 63-288 cm TL. In terms of landed weight of the Silky Shark, in Ecuador in the early 2000s, less than 400 t were landed annually, and from 2007-2011, 900-1,300 t per year were landed (IATTC 2013). Catch records from 2007-2008 for nine ports in Ecuador show that catches of Silky Shark was highest in the warmer summer months from March-August (IATTC 2011). Individuals landed were mainly 114-246 cm TL for females and 101-233 cm TL for males with a peak at 160 cm TL for both sexes (IATTC 2011). This peak corresponds to immature individuals, therefore, a majority of the Silky Shark landed in Ecuador is immature.<br/><br/><strong>Western Central Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>The tropical waters of the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) currently support the largest industrial tuna fishery in the world with an annual tuna catch approaching one million tonnes. The two main gear types, longline and purse seine, accounted for over 90% of the target tuna catch in this area in 1999 (Williams 1999). The most prevalent bycatch species found in the longline fishery are Silky Shark, Blue Shark, Pelagic Stingray (<em>Pteroplatytrygon violacea</em>), and the Oceanic Whitetip (<em>Carcharhinus longimanus</em>) (Williams 1999). The most prevalent bycatch species in the purse seine fishery is Silky Shark accounting for 95% of the elasmobranch bycatch in the FAD-associated purse seiners (Hutchinson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Due to the high rate of exploitation in the Indo-Pacific, the Silky Shark population is at risk of genetic diversity loss (Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2015b).<br/><br/>In the WCPO, the longline fishery catches the highest number of Silky Shark with the estimated catch (based on observer data) in 2009 of 189,000 individuals compared to 69,790 individual Silky Shark taken in the same year for the purse seine fishery (Lawson 2011). Once brailed from purse seines, Silky Shark have been shown to be deceased 72% of the time when brought on board (Poisson <em>et al</em>. 2014). They have also been shown in the WCPO purse seine fishery to have a high post-release mortality of greater than 84% (Hutchinson <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the WCPO, longlines and purse seines mainly catch juveniles (Rice and Harley 2013). In the western Pacific, a CPUE for Silky Shark of 1-25 kg per set was found on purse seine sets on tuna schools unassociated with FADs from 1998-2010 (Leroy <em>et al</em>. 2013). On purse seine sets on anchored FADs, the CPUE from 1998-2010 was between 5-50 kg per set and on drifting FADs, the CPUE was 25-60 kg per set (Leroy <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In pelagic longlines based off Hawaii, Silky Shark is caught mainly on deep sea sets. Most of the Silky Shark catch (62.5%) was taken above the equator (0° to 10°N), even though only 3% of fishing was observed above the equator (Walsh and Clarke 2011).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, reported catches of Silky Shark increased by 1,058 t from 2003-2011 (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016). This may be due to better reporting. Malaysia does not report catches but does list Silky Shark as a commercial species that is used for fins and meat. Silky Shark is sold locally in Malaysia and prices have been increasing (Lack and Sant 2012). Similarly, Vietnam has no data available on the amount of Silky Shark caught, but it is included in catch reports of sharks (Lack and Sant 2012). In Thailand, Silky Shark is noted as being caught at a “normal” amount, however, there is little training for fisheries officers in identification. This may account for an underestimation of Silky Shark catch (Krajangdara 2014).<br/><br/>Papua New Guinea had a coastal longline shark fishery in which Silky Shark made up &gt;50% of the shark catch (Kumoru 2003). The fishery ceased in June 2014 due to the WCPFC requirement to not land or retain Silky Shark (see the <em>Conservation</em> section). Over 765 t of Silky Shark was caught in 2001. In 2011, 72% of sharks caught on longlines was Silky Shark (Lack and Sant 2012). The proportion of Silky Shark in the shark longline catch was &gt;50% through 2013-mid 2014 (Jonathan Smart, pers. comms 2015). In the Solomon Islands, Silky Shark accounted for 23% of all longline bycatch and 84% of purse seine bycatch (in data collated in 2009; Lack and Meere 2009). The meat is kept for local subsistence and fins are exported. As of 2006, all fin exporters had to be licensed which increased the reliability of reported catches (McCoy 2006). In Fiji, Silky Shark accounted for 13% of longline bycatch and was caught in low levels in the purse seine fishery (2009 collated data; Lack and Meere 2009).<br/><br/>The Silky Shark is a very common component of shark and tuna longline and tuna gillnet fisheries in Indonesia (Pacific and Indian Oceans) (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Indonesia’s reported shark catch represents 13% of the global total shark catch. Of this, 15% were reported as Silky Shark from 2001-2004. This represents an average annual catch of 15,943 t of Silky Shark (Lack and Sant 2012). Since 2009, a National Plan of Action-Sharks (NPOA) in Indonesia has been implemented and Silky Shark is listed as a commercial species in the Indonesian NPOA (Lack and Sant 2012). Silky Shark is fished over its entire size range with larger individuals caught on longlines at the beginning of the season and smaller individuals caught in gillnets once the catch rate on longlines decreases (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>The Silky Shark is caught by Australian longline fisheries operating on both the east and west coasts, that is, in the Pacific and Indian Oceans respectively (Australian Fisheries Management Authority 2014). Due to management restrictions, total retained catch of sharks by these fisheries is low and Silky Shark is not a major of component of those that are retained. Overall effort on the west coast of Australia is low. Due to the spatial distribution of effort on the east coast (greatest between 25-30°S), few Silky Shark are captured. No assessment of Silky Shark has been undertaken by Australia (although the east coast fishery data was included in the WCPO Silky Shark stock assessment) (Rice and Harley 2013). Australia has a range of management measures in place to mitigate impacts on all sharks. These include trip limits of a maximum of 20 sharks, a ban on the use of wire traces and shark finning bans (Gilman <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean</strong><br/>Pelagic fisheries have operated in the Indian Ocean for more than 50 years; Japanese long-liners in the eastern Indian Ocean since 1952 and in the western region since 1956. Russian, Taiwanese, and South Korean vessels have fished there since 1954-1966 (Gubanov and Paramonov 1993). Sharks are targeted in several areas, including off India where they are captured using hook and line and in large mesh gillnets, which are among the world’s largest (Anderson and Simpfendorfer 2005). Silky Shark was the most commonly caught shark at FADs in the Indian Ocean during a small pilot study of observers onboard French vessels—61.5% of Silky Shark was discarded dead at sea, 30.5% partially alive kept onboard, ~7% discarded alive (Viera and Pianet 2006). In a more recent study of FADs in the Indian Ocean, it was estimated that 480,000-960,000 Silky Shark become entangled and subsequently die annually in Indian Ocean FADs (Filmalter <em>et al</em>. 2013). The number of Silky Shark that die by becoming entangled in the FADs was estimated as 5-10 times higher than the number estimated to be taken as bycatch in Indian Ocean FAD-associated purse seine sets (Filmalter <em>et al</em>. 2013). Sharks that were caught in FADs died and fell out within two days, therefore, there is the potential for very high levels of cryptic mortality on FADs (Filmalter <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Indian Ocean, due to the high abundance of FADs, it was estimated a Silky Shark has a 29% chance of surviving to age 1, 9% chance of survival to 2 years, and only a 3% chance of survival to 3 years old (Filmalter <em>et al</em>. 2013). On the Southwest coast of India, at Cochin, Silky Shark was recorded as a small portion of landed sharks through 2000-2002. In 2010, their contribution had increased to 16.3% of shark landings at Cochin (Kizhakudan <em>et al</em>. 2013); however, this increased contribution may partly be as a result of potential increase in reporting.<br/><br/>In the Maldives, it was estimated that some 85% of oceanic shark catch comprise Silky Shark (Anderson and Jauharee 2009). Although no specific data were available, Maldivian shark fishermen who specialize in longlining for oceanic sharks anecdotally reported declines in abundance and average size of Silky Shark; all fishers commented that Silky Shark numbers had decreased by &gt;50% in the past 20 years (Anderson and Jauharee 2009). A fishery for Silky Shark has operated off Sri Lanka for many years and Sri Lanka are one of the only countries to report species-specific Silky Shark catch to FAO. The Silky Shark reported landings have decreased in Sri Lanka from 2003 to 2011 by 2,798 t (Davidson <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong><br/>The first longline fisheries in the Atlantic were begun by the Japanese fleet in 1956 in the western equatorial waters (Uozumi and Nakano 1996). The fleet expanded rapidly in the 1960s, and covered almost the entire Atlantic by the late 1960s (Bonfil 1994), including the areas currently fished by the American fleet. Fishing pressure in the Atlantic Ocean longline fisheries is high and ongoing. In the United States, Silky Shark is caught by the commercial shark bottom longline and the pelagic longline fishery, and in recreational shark fisheries. In the shark bottom longline fishery in Gulf of Mexico and Southern Atlantic, Silky Shark represent a major by-product species (Enzenauer <em>et al</em>. 2015). Approximately 75% of individuals caught are retained, mainly comprising small individuals (&lt;110 cm TL). The rest are discarded, of which one third are discarded dead (Enzenauer <em>et al</em>. 2015). Silky Shark is one of the five most captured shark species caught in the Cuban longline fishery (Espinosa 2004).<br/><br/>Silky Shark is taken in several longline fisheries in the Southwest Atlantic, including those off Santos, southern Brazil (Arfelli and Amorim 1994, Amorim <em>et al</em>. 1998), Natal, northeastern Brazil (Hazin <em>et al</em>. 1990) and Uruguay (Marín <em>et al</em>. 1998). The species is taken in artisanal gillnet fisheries off southern Paraná State (Costa and Chaves 2006). In Brazil, Silky Shark is generally retained and marketed (Arfelli and Amorim 1994, Marín <em>et al</em>. 1998). Silky Shark catch in the longline tuna fishery off Brazil increased from 2004-2008 and then declined from 2008-2010 (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2015). The highest catch rates occurred near the coast, with two exceptions in the central Atlantic. Similar to most catch data of Silky Shark, a high proportion of individuals were immature (Fredou <em>et al</em>. 2015). In another part of the Atlantic, in Spain, the landings of Silky Shark plummeted in the early 2000s from 17 t in 2002 to ~1 t in 2011 (Eurostat 2013).",Marine,Vulnerable,Carcharhinidae
Centroscymnus coelolepis,"<p>The&#160;Portuguese Dogfish&#160;has been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in demersal trawl, demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries. The species will have refuge at depth; most records of the species are at depths &gt;900 m (e.g. Kulka 2006, Chazeau <em>et al</em>. 2019) and its peak distribution in the Northeast Atlantic was between 1,200–1,500 m (Neat <em>et al</em>. 2015). There is little to no known fishing effort in the Northwest Atlantic and Mediterranean that reaches these depths. <br/><br/>This species was previously reported in trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope of the Northeast Atlantic (Gordon 1999), and was historically exploited commercially. Landings of the Portuguese Dogfish&#160;were historically aggregated with other deep-water dogfish (primarily the Leafscale Gulper Shark,&#160;<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>)&#160;in a mixed landing category, referred to as “siki” shark (ICES-WGEF 2018).&#160;Since the introduction of TAC of zero in 2010, it is likely that discarding and misreporting of the species has increased (ICES-WGEF 2018).&#160;In 2014, 50% of sampled specimens collected from longliners and landed as the Tope Shark,&#160;<em>Galeorhinus galeus</em>, were found to be Leafscale Gulper Shark or Portuguese Dogfish (ICES-WGEF 2018). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in demersal fisheries (e.g. Moura&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;Discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sánchez 2017) and the extent of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is unknown (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). A lack of species-specific information limits the ability to identify which species are reported from the region.&#160;Deep-water sharks, which may include the Portuguese Dogfish, were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from Black Hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em> and <em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Somniosid sharks (<em>Centroscymnus </em>spp) are occasionally reported (&lt;1 t between 2010–12) in demersal offshore trawl fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>In Suruga Bay, Japan, historic exploitation peaked during World War II when the species was utilized for its liver oil (Stevens and Correia 2003). In recent years, the species is infrequently reported from the region (S. Tanaka, unpubl. data 2019) and this may be attributed to refuge at depth. The&#160;Portuguese Dogfish has been reported in the region from depths &gt;750 m (Yano and Tanaka 1987), and current fishing operations, including&#160;a&#160;deep-water dropline fishery for Splendid Alfonsino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>), which operates around the islands and seamounts south of Sagami Bay at depths of 400–800 m (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018). A<a>&#160;semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current industrial fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has refuge at depth&#160;(T. Walker unpubl. data 2019). </a><br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Of the ~1,800 t of deep-water shark catches reported in the Southern Indian Ocean in 2016, ~1,300 t was the Portuguese Dogfish (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). The species is also occasionally reported from demersal longline fisheries operating on the Kerguelen Plateau (Chazeau<em> et al. </em>2019).</p>",Marine,Near Threatened,Somniosidae
Squalus clarkae,"There is little information available on catch or bycatch of this species, mainly because there are few deep-water fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea.&#160;Only six sharks were reported as bycatch from 2006–2012 in the reef-fish demersal longline fishery observer data and 33% of those were released alive (Gulak and Carlson 2013).&#160;In addition, 28 sharks were reported as bycatch from 2005–2012 in deep demersal “shark targeted” longline fishery observer data; 50% of those were released alive and 14% were kept (Gulak and Carlson 2013).&#160;This species may also be caught in directed tilefish fisheries that operate as deep as 300 m&#160;and this species is reported among the bycatch of&#160;as the royal red shrimp trawl fishery in the US Gulf of Mexico that operates at depths of 250–550 m (Stiles&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Driggers&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, E. Scott-Denton pers. comm. 12/05/2020). Demersal trawling occurs on relatively restricted fishing grounds adjacent to home ports (Stiles&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007). Observer coverage in the royal red shrimp fishery has also been low (Scott-Denton&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012) and so bycatch information is scarce and reported as presence/absence. In the US Gulf of Mexico longline fishery this species is&#160;<a>occasionally&#160;</a>captured (28 recorded), however few (~17%) are discarded alive (Hale&#160;<em>et al.&#160;2</em>011). Information is lacking on the post-release survival of the live releases, however a study conducted in the Bahamas on a congener (<em>Squalus cubensis</em>)<em>&#160;</em>reported post-release survival from research longlines of around 50% (Talwar&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017). This species is likely occasionally caught in artisanal handline fisheries in the southern Gulf of Mexico (<span class=""text surname"">Pérez-Jiménez&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015).&#160;There are generally few deep-water shark fisheries throughout the Caribbean.&#160;The exception is a deep-set artisanal gillnet fishery off&#160;Margarita Island, Venezuela, which is intense and unregulated (O. Lasso 16/11/2018), however this represents a small fraction of this species’ range.",Marine,Least Concern,Squalidae
Hemitriakis abdita,"The Darksnout Hound Shark is a possible bycatch of trawl and line fisheries operating off north Queensland. While there has been no trawl effort in the Commonwealth-managed Coral Sea Fishery since the 2006–07 fishing season, this shark is a possible bycatch of auto-longline and dropline gear used in the fishery. In general, the Coral Sea Fishery is low effort and low catch with only a small number of active fishing vessels (Hansen and Mazur 2015).<br/><p>The Queensland managed Deep Water Fin Fish Fishery which operates east of the 200 m depth contour, may overlap with the range of this species. This fishery expanded during the 1990s but in recent years, entry to the fishery has been limited with only seven licenses currently available (Sumpton&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). Although the management area of the fishery is extensive, current operators are based mainly in southern Queensland and in 2012–13 only two vessels were active, while there was no reported effort in 2013-14 (Sumpton&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013; DAF 2015). This fishery uses multi-hook line fishing gear targeting mainly benthopelagic species and ‘Gummy Sharks’ are a component of the ‘shark (unspecified)’ catch, which was a significant component of the overall catch of the fishery in 2008–09 (DEEDI 2009), and which may include the Darksnout Hound Shark. The 2008–09 commercial harvest of the fishery (all species) was 171 tonnes, but the size of the ‘shark (unspecified)’ catch within that amount is not available due to confidentiality policies (DEEDI 2009).</p>",Marine,Data Deficient,Triakidae

Squalus shiraii,"Shirai's Spurdog is subject to fishing pressure across its range. Like other squalids, it is likely to be taken as bycatch by demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet and at least in Japan, likely retained. In Japan, fisheries developed rapidly during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al.</em> 2011). Since then, the fishing effort has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly during the period 1998–2007 from 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (FAO 2019, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 28 August 2019).<br/><br/>The species may be taken as bycatch on the Emperor Seamount fisheries. Research surveys have caught <em>Squalus</em> species on the Emperor Seamounts (Seki and Tagami 1986). Commercial catches of this species are unknown and it is unknown if it is retained or discarded. The fisheries in the region have operated since 1967 and fished heavily during the 1960s to 1980s mostly at depths of 300–600 m (Baco <em>et al.</em> 2019). The fisheries currently operate mostly on the southern Emperor seamounts, which encompass the known range of this species and mostly operate at the known depth of this species, that is, at 300–500 m (CHM 2016, Shotton 2016, NPFC 2020). The demersal trawl fisheries mainly target North Pacific Armourhead (<em>Pentaceros wheeleri</em>) and Splendid Alfosino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) (Froese and Pauly 2019, NPFC 2020).",Marine,Vulnerable,Squalidae
Etmopterus brosei,"Lanternsharks (<em>Etmopterus</em> spp.) are reported as incidental catch in offshore demersal deep-water trawl fisheries, and possibly demersal deep-water longline fisheries, operating off southern Africa (da Silva <em>et al.</em> 2015). It is unlikely to be retained as it is too small to be of commercial value (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2021b).<br/><br/>There are a number of industrial demersal trawl fisheries, some dating back to the 1960s, which operate in the southwest Indian Ocean and target a mixture of high-value crustaceans (deep-water prawns, lobsters, crabs) at depths of 300–700 m (Groeneveld and Everett 2015). Bycatch comprises a considerable amount of the catch, with sharks, fish, and cephalopods comprising ~85% of catch by weight (Doherty&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015). A mixture of demersal and mid-water trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries also operate, some of which are unregulated, and target commercial fish species such as Alfonsino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>), Orange Roughy (<em>Hoplostethus atlanticus</em>), and deep-water sharks (Bensch&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009, Garcia&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013, Georgeson <em>et al</em>. 2020). The sympatric Sculpted Lanternshark has a similar depth (240–1,023 m) and spatial range to that of Barrie’s Lanternshark and is encountered in the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA) Convention Area and was assessed as at low risk from the trawl, longline, and gillnet gear in the SIOFA fisheries (Georgeson <em>et al.</em> 2020). The Sculpted Lanternshark has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as most of the population occurs in waters deeper than fisheries, providing it considerable refuge at depth (Pollom <em>et al. </em>2019, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2021b). This implies that Barrie’s Lanternshark also has refuge at depth and is likely at low risk from these southwest Indian Ocean fisheries.",Marine,Least Concern,Etmopteridae
Mustelus andamanensis,"The Andaman Smoothhound is subject to fishing pressure across its spatial and depth range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, longline, and gillnet. All incidental catch is retained for the meat and fins.<br/><br/>Sharks and rays are captured by a wide range of gears in Myanmar. In coastal waters before a nation a wide ban on targeting sharks in 2004, large sharks were targeted by pelagic longlines up to 3 km in length. Since 2004, sharks are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls (for fish or shrimp), longlines targeting mackerels, and hookah divers spearing at night (mostly catching rays and carpet sharks) (Howard <em>et al</em>. 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al</em>. 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small scale, and include many subsistence level fishers. At times, since 1950, significant numbers of foreign vessels have operated in Myanmar waters targeting fish and shrimp. These vessels have operated in both inshore and offshore areas. Offshore fishing that incidentally catches sharks and rays is carried out by a large commercial fleet of mostly trawlers, purse seiners and longliners. International Labour Organisation (2015) estimated of the number of vessels participating in the small-scale inshore fishery to be about 26,000 in 2013, with about 50% of them unpowered. The number of locally operated larger offshore vessels numbered 2,846 in 2013, having increased nearly 30% since 2009. Foreign fishing vessels numbered 153 in 2013, but had historically been much higher. Foreign vessels were banned in 2014.<br/><br/>In Thailand, this species would be caught primarily in two gears: otter board-trawl (70% of catch) and paired trawl (16–25% of catch) (Krajangdara 2019). The number of Thai trawlers peaked in 1989 at ~13,100 boats (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000), which was reflected in the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) which declined from &gt;300 kg per hour in 1963 to 20–30 kg per hour in the 1990s (Poonnachit-Korsieporn 2000). Fisheries in Thailand have been moving to deeper water for decades due to the overexploitation of the coastal region (Sylwester 2014).<br/><br/>In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, intensive longline and handline fishing pressure targeting groupers and snappers at depths of 50–150 m may incidentally catch a high number of individual sharks, including this species (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2020).<br/><br/>There is a large amount of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Indo-Pacific region with reported catch estimated to represent only 0.9–19.4% of the true catch (Tull 2014). In some areas, including near Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), IUU catch of sharks was estimated to equal 77% of the reported catch, indicating much higher levels of depletion (Varkey <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Marine,Vulnerable,Triakidae
Carcharodon carcharias,"<p>The White Shark is caught as bycatch mostly in inshore fisheries in a range of gears, such as longlines, setlines, gillnets, trawls, hand-held rod and reel, and fish-traps; it is rarely caught in offshore pelagic fisheries (Bruce 2008, Lowe <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dewar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Lyons <em>et al</em>. 2013, Francis 2017, Onate-Gonzalez <em>et al. </em>2017). The species has a relatively high post-release survival in net fisheries (Lyons <em>et al.</em> 2013, Benson <em>et al. </em>2018). The White Shark is targeted in beach protection programs in Australia and South Africa that use drum-lines and gillnets; however, in some instances these programs release live sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Bruce 2008, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011, Braccini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Kock <em>et al.</em> 2018, Lee<em> et al. </em>2018, Roff <em>et al.</em> 2018).

Alopias vulpinus,"The Common Thresher is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic&#160;longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martinez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015).<p>The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention<em>.</em> Under-reporting of catches in the pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The species is highly valued by big-game recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality that has been estimated for the Common Thresher as 78% for tail-hooked and 0% for mouth-hooked animals (i.e. all mouth-hooked animals survived) (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Sepulveda <em>et al. </em>2015).<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""> At vessel mortality of 66.7% was estimated on Portuguese longlines in the Atlantic (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;</span></span></p>",Marine,Vulnerable,Alopiidae

Carcharhinus hemiodon,"Shallow-water demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted across the range of the Pondicherry Shark (e.g. Stobutzki <em>et al.</em> 2006), and this species is unlikely to have found any refuge as fishing effort in coastal waters and on the continental shelf has been extensive. Shark fishing (targeted or bycatch) is widespread, intensive, and generally unregulated across its range and practices are well known to be unsustainable (e.g. Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, Dharmadi <em>et al.</em> 2015, Arunrugstichai <em>et al.</em> 2018). Sharks are captured in commercial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple fishing gears, including gillnet, trawl, hook and line, trap, and seine net and are generally retained for meat and fins. Other small-bodied resilient whaler sharks that are the mainstay of fisheries elsewhere are declining or have collapsed in India, including Spadenose Shark (<em>Scoliodon laticaudus</em>) and 'blacktip' sharks (<em>Carcharhinus</em> spp.) (Mohamed and Veena 2016), and this situation is repeated across the region.<br/><br/>The Pondicherry Shark was likely to be taken by inshore gillnet and line fisheries within its range and its small size suggests that like other small carcharhinids, it was susceptible to trawl fisheries.&#160;In India, there are over 13,400 gill netters operating along the west coast, with many other types of net gear deployed in coastal areas (CMFRI 2010). Furthermore,&#160;there were about 6,600 trawlers operating in the Indian state of Gujarat in the early 2000s (Zynudheen <em>et al.</em> 2004). This number almost doubled to 11,582 trawlers in 2010 (CMFRI 2010) and all Indian states have high numbers of trawlers operating.&#160;In Pakistan waters, about 14,000 fishing vessels, including about 2,000 shrimp trawlers, operate in shallow coastal and offshore shelf waters (M. Khan unpubl. data 2017). In Oman, almost 19,000 artisanal vessels operate in coastal waters using a variety of net and line gear (Jabado and Spaet 2017).

Hexanchus vitulus,"The Atlantic Sixgill Shark is infrequently reported as incidental catch from industrial and artisanal demersal trawl, gillnet, and longline fisheries from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. A total of 133 Atlantic Sixgill Sharks were reported as incidental catch from 2006 to 2012 in the reef fish bottom longline fishery observer data and most (83%) were released alive (Gulak and Carlson 2013). This species may also be caught in directed tilefish fisheries that operate as deep as 300 m, as well as the royal red shrimp trawl fishery in the US Gulf of Mexico that operates at depths of 250–550 m (Stiles <em>et al</em>. 2007, Driggers <em>et al</em>. 2015). Trawling occurs on relatively restricted fishing grounds adjacent to home ports (Stiles <em>et al</em>. 2007). At-vessel longline mortality is likely to be low, but post-release mortality is unknown (Brooks <em>et al</em>. 2015, Talwar <em>et al</em>. 2017). Elsewhere in the region, the species is at increasing risk of capture as small-scale fisheries expand into deeper waters. Deepwater sharks are caught off Saba Bank (de Graaf <em>et al</em>. 2017), Curaçao (Van Beek <em>et al</em>. 2013), and northern Cuba (Ruiz-Abierno <em>et al</em>. 2021). The Atlantic Sixgill Shark is becoming more frequently recorded at local landing sites in Belize and Guatemala (Baremore <em>et al</em>. 2021, Hacohen-Domené <em>et al</em>. 2020, Quinlan <em>et al</em>. 2021).",Marine,Least Concern,Hexanchidae

The Mexican Hornshark&#160;is utilized occasionally but is typically discarded.

Centrophorus atromarginatus,"This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is a taken as a target and bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple gears including deep-water demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet. It is retained for the meat, fins, liver oil, and fish meal.<br/><br/>In Japan, this species is targeted for its liver oil in Suruga Bay, Honshu with deep-water gillnets (McCormack and White 2009). It is also taken as bycatch of demersal trawls and retained for the meat and fins. Fisheries developed rapidly in Japan during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). The fishing effort within the Japanese EEZ declined by approximately one-third from 1950s to the mid-1990s (Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011). Since then it has remained relatively stable, with only a slight decline; the number of powered vessels operating across the EEZ declined slightly from 1998 to 2007 at 236,000 to 232,534 (Schmidt 2003, Anticamara <em>et al</em>. 2011, FAO 2019). Demersal trawl fisheries effort has decreased markedly over the last three decades and is continuing to decline, mostly due to the significant decline in the numbers of fishers and vessels participating in the fishery as fishers age and a lack of young people move into the industry (NFMT 2017, FAO 2019, S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). The trawl fisheries are also strictly managed to limit effort with spatial and temporal closures (S. Tanaka pers. comm. 01 September 2019). Demand for seafood in Japan is extremely high at 53.7 kg per capita in 2013 (FAO 2019, Helgil 2019a).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the EEZ, and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989 at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010,&#160; Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpub. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283 to 239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273 to 12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpub. data 2019). Seine nets and demersal trawls are the main gear types, accounting for 46% and 19% of the total coastal and offshore fisheries catch respectively, followed by longline (7%) and gillnet (4%) (Fisheries Agency 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high and was 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2019b). Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2016).<br/><br/>In Papua New Guinea, the species is not encountered by commercial fishers as it occurs at depths not yet fished (White <em>et al</em>. 2017). In Indonesia, deep-water demersal longlines operate at depths of 150–600 m and capture and retain the Dwarf Gulper Shark (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Fishing pressure in Indonesia is intense with the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally, and substantial catches of target and bycatch chondrichthyans (White <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas region, the major threat to the Dwarf Gulper Shark is the rapid expansion of deep-water fisheries off western India, including a targeted <em>Centrophorus</em> fishery that commenced in 2002, and a deep-water shrimp trawl fishery which takes the species as bycatch. The shrimp trawl fishery developed in 1999 and expanded rapidly with trawler numbers peaking soon thereafter in 2000–2001 before dropping significantly, although there are still some 300–400 boats operating in the fishery (Fernandez <em>et al</em>. 2015). The fishery operates on the Quilon Bank and Wedge Bank areas off southwest India at depths of 200–500 m <em>Centrophorus</em> species are a major bycatch of this fishery (Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2011, Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2013a, Akhilesh <em>et al</em>. 2013b). As marine fish stocks from nearshore waters off India are heavily exploited, it is likely that fisheries will continue to expand into deeper water. There is little information available on deep-water fishing activities around Sri Lanka, although the Dwarf Gulper Sharks is likely captured by local line fishers where there is easy access to deep-water habitat relatively close to shore (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2016, Fernando <em>et al</em>. 2019). There is currently no deep-water fishing where the species occurs off Oman. In Somalia in the mid-1970s, there was commercial deep-water trawling and  since then several foreign fishing companies have been given fishing  licenses to fish in the offshore Somalia EEZ (FAO 2008) and illegal and unregulated fishing is ongoing (Jabado <em>et al</em>. 2017).",Marine,Critically Endangered,Centrophoridae
Centrophorus longipinnis,"The Longfin Gulper Shark  is taken as bycatch by deep-water trawl and likely deep-water longline, and retained for the meat, fins, liver oil, and for fish meal. The species is a bycatch of deep-water trawl fisheries that operate off  the northeast and southwest coasts of Taiwan at depths of 300–700 m;  these fisheries target multiple species of shrimp with all the incidental catch retained (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013; reported as <em>Centrophorus cf. lusitanicus</em> (Lowfin  Gulper Shark), D. Ebert unpub. data 2019). The fishery on the east coast, particularly operations out of Da-xi, has moved into deeper  waters over the past 30 years (from 1998 to 2019) due to depletion of shallow water shrimp species. The fishery has moved from fishing depths of 100–300 m to depths of 300–700 m (D. Ebert unpub. data 2019). Prior to 30 years ago (about one generation length) this species would not have been fished in Taiwan as it was beyond the depth of the fishing gear. During the monsoon season, conditions preclude deep-water trawling  and some trawlers operate in the shallower depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho  pers. comm. 28/08/2019); this would provide a reprieve from fishing pressure for the Longfin Gulper Shark. Deep-water longlines in Taiwan operate at depths of 100–300 m (H. Ho and H. Hsu pers. comm. 28/08/2019) and thus are unlikely to capture this species as its upper depth limit is beyond the reach of the longline gear.<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s, coastal fisheries were considered overfished, and fisheries expanded into offshore waters within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and distant waters. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H.

The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273–12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpub. data 2019). In Taiwan, the demand for seafood has always been high at 31.2 kg per capita in 2013 (Helgil 2019). Fish too small for human consumption are in demand for processing into fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry that produces double the quantity of seafood taken from wild capture fisheries in Taiwan waters (NDC 2016).<br/><br/>In Indonesia, this species is likely taken on deep-water demersal longlines that operate at depths of 150–600 m (White <em>et al</em>. 2006). Fishing pressure in Indonesia is intense with the largest chondrichthyan fishery globally, and substantial catches of target and bycatch chondrichthyans (White<em> et al</em>. 2006). Indonesia has been among the top shark fishing nation for over 20 years (Oakes and Sant 2019). The deep-water demersal longlines fishing effort has remained relatively constant over the past 15 years, except for West Java where the fishery ceased operating in ~2010 (Fahmi unpub. data 2020). In the Philippines, the species' upper-depth limit is beyond the reach of the trawl fisheries that operate to a maximum depth of 200 m (D. Tanay unpub. data 2020). It may have previously been encountered in the Philippines by bottom set multiple hook-and-line gear that targeted dogfish sharks for their liver oil; the fishery was intensive from the 1960s–1980s and still operates but at an artisanal scale and not in the western Sulu Sea area (Gaudiano and Alava 2003, Flores 2004, D. Tanay unpub. data 2020, J. Utzurrum unpub. data 2020).

Centrophorus moluccensis,"Gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus</em> spp.) have been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and demersal trawl, surface and demersal longline, and setnet fisheries.<br/><br/>In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2018). Off Western Australia, a targeted gillnet fishery for deep-water dogfish (mainly <em>Centrophorus</em> spp.) operated between 1996–1999; the fishery ceased after three years due to rapid declines in catch (Daley <em>et al</em>. 2002). A semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current industrial fishing as fishing effort has been reduced off the eastern coast of Australia and the south coast of Western Australia between Cape Leeuwin and Albany where the species occurs (T. Walker unpub. data 2019). Also, the species now has refuge along much of the west coast of Australia where only three trawlers were active during the 2017‒2018 fishing season (Mazloumi <em>et al</em>. 2019), as well as off the west Pacific Islands where there are no known deep-water fisheries.<br/><br/>Where targeted fishing occurs, fishing activity has been intensive. In the Philippines, deep-water dogfish fisheries (<em>Centrophorus</em> spp. and <em>Squalus</em> spp.), dating back to the 1960s, are known for their boom-and-bust nature and collapse over short periods of time (~10 years) before effort is shifted into new regions (Flores 2004). Deep-water dogfishes, including a number of <em>Centrophorus</em> spp., are targeted and/or retained as bycatch throughout Indonesia for their high value liver oil (White <em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaber <em>et al</em>. 2009, Gunawan 2013, Samusamu and Dharmadi 2017). Fisheries occur at depths of 200–800 m (Samusamu and Dharmadi, 2017), but have also been reported near shore at depths &lt;100 m (Gunawan 2013). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across Indonesia, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in many areas across the Indo-West Pacific (Stobutzki <em>et al</em>. 2006). Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high, but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). Targeting gulper shark fishing has also occurred off the Andaman Islands since the 1980s (Soundararajan and Roy 2004).<br/><br/>A number of deep-water demersal trawl fisheries, some dating back to 1968, operate in the Southwest Indian Ocean (Groeneveld and Everett 2015). These fisheries target a mixture of high-value crustaceans (deep-water prawns, lobsters, crabs) at depths of 300–700 m (Groeneveld and Everett 2015). Fishing pressure in this region is expected to continue; in 2017, the fishery in Madagascar intensified from 2 to 12 Chinese deep-water trawlers in 2017 without any known management measures (R. Bennett pers. comm. 25/4/2018). Bycatch is recognised as making up a considerable amount of the catch, with sharks, fish, and cephalopods comprising ~85% of catch by weight (Doherty <em>et al</em>. 2015).",Marine,Vulnerable,Centrophoridae
Deania calceus,"The Birdbeak Dogfish has been taken as both targeted and incidental catch across its range in midwater and demersal trawl, demersal longline, and gillnet fisheries.<br/><br/>This species was previously reported in trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries targeting mixed deep-water sharks along the continental slope of the Northeast Atlantic (Gordon 1999), and was historically exploited commercially. Trawl survey records indicate peak depth distribution of the species is also at depths &gt;800 m (Neat <em>et al</em>. 2015). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in considerable quantities in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet <em>et al</em>. 2019). At vessel mortality is high, and post release mortality is likely to be high as well (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sanchez 2017).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, there was an apparent increase in reported landings of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the East Central Atlantic region (e.g. Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em> and <em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005, Kainge <em>et al</em>. 2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches are difficult to determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005). <em>Deania</em>. spp are occasionally reported (annual catch of &lt;1 t between 2010–12) in demersal inshore and offshore hake trawl fisheries off South Africa (da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015), and in hake fisheries operating off Chile (SUBPESCA 2017).<br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson <em>et al</em>. 2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Birdbeak Dogfish to have extreme vulnerability to midwater trawl and demersal longline fisheries in Southern Indian Ocean, and extreme vulnerability to demersal trawl and demersal longline in South Pacific Ocean fisheries (Georgeson <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>In the Indo-Pacific, the&#160;Birdbeak Dogfish is one of the most deep-water shark species reported as bycatch from offshore deep-water fisheries in New Zealand (Francis 2015), with trawl survey records indicating peak depth distribution at depths &gt;800 m (Anderson <em>et al</em>. 1998). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson <em>et al</em>. 2018). A qualitative risk assessment for New Zealand's chondrichthyans ranked this species as one of the highest species at risk from industrial fishing that is not managed by the Quota Management System (QMS) (Ford&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018), and <a>a semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current industrial fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has refuge at depth (T. Walker, unpubl. data 2019). Any <em>Deania </em>spp caught in Taiwanese fisheries is likely retained and sold locally (Liu <em>et al</em>. 2013).</a>",Marine,Near Threatened,Centrophoridae
